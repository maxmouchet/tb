THE TWO FACTORS OF A COMMODITY:
USE-VALUE AND VALUE
(THE SUBSTANCE OF VALUE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF VALUE)



The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production
prevails, presents itself as "an immense accumulation of commodities," [1]
its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin
with the analysis of a commodity.

A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by
its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another. The nature of
such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from
fancy, makes no difference. [2] Neither are we here concerned to know how
the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence,
or indirectly as means of production.

Every useful thing, as iron, paper, &c., may be looked at from the two
points of view of quality and quantity. It is an assemblage of many
properties, and may therefore be of use in various ways. To discover the
various uses of things is the work of history. [3] So also is the
establishment of socially-recognized standards of measure for the
quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of these measures has its
origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, partly
in convention.

The utility of a thing makes it a use-value. [4] But this utility is not a
thing of air. Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity, it
has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such as iron,
corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a
use-value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of
the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities. When
treating of use-value, we always assume to be dealing with definite
quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron. The
use-values of commodities furnish the material for a special study, that of
the commercial knowledge of commodities. [5] Use-values become a reality
only by use or consumption: they also constitute the substance of all
wealth, whatever may be the social form of that wealth. In the form of
society we are about to consider, they are, in addition, the material
depositories of exchange-value.

Exchange-value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation,
as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for
those of another sort, [6] a relation constantly changing with time and
place. Hence exchange-value appears to be something accidental and purely
relative, and consequently an intrinsic value, i.e., an exchange-value that
is inseparably connected with, inherent in commodities, seems a
contradiction in terms. [7] Let us consider the matter a little more
closely.

A given commodity, e.g., a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking, y
silk, or z gold, &c. — in short, for other commodities in the most
different proportions. Instead of one exchange-value, the wheat has,
therefore, a great many. But since x blacking, y silk, or z gold &c., each
represents the exchange-value of one quarter of wheat, x blacking, y silk,
z gold, &c., must, as exchange-values, be replaceable by each other, or
equal to each other. Therefore, first: the valid exchange-values of a given
commodity express something equal; secondly, exchange-value, generally, is
only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in
it, yet distinguishable from it.

Let us take two commodities, e.g., corn and iron. The proportions in which
they are exchangeable, whatever those proportions may be, can always be
represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to
some quantity of iron: e.g., 1 quarter corn = x cwt. iron. What does this
equation tell us? It tells us that in two different things — in 1 quarter
of corn and x cwt. of iron, there exists in equal quantities something
common to both. The two things must therefore be equal to a third, which in
itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of them, so far as it is
exchange-value, must therefore be reducible to this third.

A simple geometrical illustration will make this clear. In order to
calculate and compare the areas of rectilinear figures, we decompose them
into triangles. But the area of the triangle itself is expressed by
something totally different from its visible figure, namely, by half the
product of the base multiplied by the altitude. In the same way the
exchange-values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms
of something common to them all, of which thing they represent a greater or
less quantity.

This common "something" cannot be either a geometrical, a chemical, or any
other natural property of commodities. Such properties claim our attention
only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities, make them
use-values. But the exchange of commodities is evidently an act
characterised by a total abstraction from use-value. Then one use-value is
just as good as another, provided only it be present in sufficient
quantity. Or, as old Barbon says, "one sort of wares are as good as
another, if the values be equal. There is no difference or distinction in
things of equal value.... An hundred pounds' worth of lead or iron, is of
as great value as one hundred pounds' worth of silver or gold." [8] As
use-values, commodities are, above all, of different qualities, but as
exchange-values they are merely different quantities, and consequently do
not contain an atom of use-value.

If then we leave out of consideration the use-value of commodities, they
have only one common property left, that of being products of labour. But
even the product of labour itself has undergone a change in our hands. If
we make abstraction from its use-value, we make abstraction at the same
time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a
use-value; we see in it no longer a table, a house, yarn, or any other
useful thing. Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight.
Neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the
joiner, the mason, the spinner, or of any other definite kind of productive
labour. Along with the useful qualities of the products themselves, we put
out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour
embodied in them, and the concrete forms of that labour; there is nothing
left but what is common to them all; all are reduced to one and the same
sort of labour, human labour in the abstract.

Let us now consider the residue of each of these products; it consists of
the same unsubstantial reality in each, a mere congelation of homogeneous
human labour, of labour-power expended without regard to the mode of its
expenditure. All that these things now tell us is, that human labour-power
has been expended in their production, that human labour is embodied in
them. When looked at as crystals of this social substance, common to them
all, they are — Values.

We have seen that when commodities are exchanged, their exchange-value
manifests itself as something totally independent of their use-value. But
if we abstract from their use-value, there remains their Value as defined
above. Therefore, the common substance that manifests itself in the
exchange-value of commodities, whenever they are exchanged, is their value.
The progress of our investigation will show that exchange-value is the only
form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed.
For the present, however, we have to consider the nature of value
independently of this, its form.

A use-value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because human
labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it. How, then,
is the magnitude of this value to be measured? Plainly, by the quantity of
the value-creating substance, the labour, contained in the article. The
quantity of labour, however, is measured by its duration, and labour-time
in its turn finds its standard in weeks, days, and hours.

Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by
the quantity of labour spent on it, the more idle and unskilful the
labourer, the more valuable would his commodity be, because more time would
be required in its production. The labour, however, that forms the
substance of value, is homogeneous human labour, expenditure of one uniform
labour-power. The total labour-power of society, which is embodied in the
sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society, counts
here as one homogeneous mass of human labour-power, composed though it be
of innumerable individual units. Each of these units is the same as any
other, so far as it has the character of the average labour-power of
society, and takes effect as such; that is, so far as it requires for
producing a commodity, no more time than is needed on an average, no more
than is socially necessary. The labour-time socially necessary is that
required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production,
and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time.
The introduction of power-looms into England probably reduced by one-half
the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth. The
hand-loom weavers, as a matter of fact, continued to require the same time
as before; but for all that, the product of one hour of their labour
represented after the change only half an hour's social labour, and
consequently fell to one-half its former value.

We see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value of any
article is the amount of labour socially necessary, or the labour-time
socially necessary for its production. [9] Each individual commodity, in
this connexion, is to be considered as an average sample of its class. [10]
Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labour are embodied,
or which can be produced in the same time, have the same value. The value
of one commodity is to the value of any other, as the labour-time necessary
for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of
the other. "As values, all commodities are only definite masses of
congealed labour-time." [11]

The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant, if the
labour-time required for its production also remained constant. But the
latter changes with every variation in the productiveness of labour. This
productiveness is determined by various circumstances, amongst others, by
the average amount of skill of the workmen, the state of science, and the
degree of its practical application, the social organisation of production,
the extent and capabilities of the means of production, and by physical
conditions. For example, the same amount of labour in favourable seasons is
embodied in 8 bushels of corn, and in unfavourable, only in four. The same
labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines. Diamonds
are of very rare occurrence on the earth's surface, and hence their
discovery costs, on an average, a great deal of labour-time. Consequently
much labour is represented in a small compass. Jacob doubts whether gold
has ever been paid for at its full value. This applies still more to
diamonds. According to Eschwege, the total produce of the Brazilian diamond
mines for the eighty years, ending in 1823, had not realised the price of
one and-a-half years' average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations
of the same country, although the diamonds cost much more labour, and
therefore represented more value. With richer mines, the same quantity of
labour would embody itself in more diamonds, and their value would fall. If
we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour, in converting carbon
into diamonds, their value might fall below that of bricks. In general, the
greater the productiveness of labour, the less is the labour-time required
for the production of an article, the less is the amount of labour
crystallised in that article, and the less is its value; and vice versâ,
the less the productiveness of labour, the greater is the labour-time
required for the production of an article, and the greater is its value.
The value of a commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and
inversely as the productiveness, of the labour incorporated in it.

A thing can be a use-value, without having value. This is the case whenever
its utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural
meadows, &c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour,
without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the
produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use-values, but not
commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce
use-values, but use-values for others, social use-values. (And not only for
others, without more. The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn for his
feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn
nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had
been produced for others. To become a commodity a product must be
transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use-value, by means of an
exchange.) [12] Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of
utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the
labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value.



SECTION 2

THE TWO-FOLD CHARACTER OF
THE LABOUR EMBODIED IN COMMODITIES


At first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two
things-use-value and exchange-value. Later on, we saw also that labour,
too, possesses the same two-fold nature; for, so far as it finds expression
in value, it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as
a creator of use-values. I was the first to point out and to examine
critically this two-fold nature of the labour contained in commodities. As
this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of Political Economy
turns, we must go more into detail.

Let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen, and let
the former be double the value of the latter, so that, if 10 yards of linen
= W, the coat = 2W.

The coat is a use-value that satisfies a particular want. Its existence is
the result of a special sort of productive activity, the nature of which is
determined by its aim, mode of operation, subject, means, and result. The
labour, whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its
product, or which manifests itself by making its product a use-value, we
call useful labour In this connexion we consider only its useful effect.

As the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different use-values, so
also are the two forms of labour that produce them, tailoring and weaving.
Were these two objects not qualitatively different, not produced
respectively by labour of different quality, they could not stand to each
other in the relation of commodities. Coats are not exchanged for coats,
one use-value is not exchanged for another of the same kind.

To all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many
different kinds of useful labour, classified according to the order, genus,
species, and variety to which they belong in the social division of labour.
This division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of
commodities, but it does not follow, conversely, that the production of
commodities is a necessary condition for the division of labour. In the
primitive Indian community there is social division of labour, without
production of commodities. Or, to take an example nearer home, in every
factory the labour is divided according to a system, but this division is
not brought about by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual
products. Only such products can become commodities with regard to each
other, as result from different kinds of labour, each kind being carried on
independently and for the account of private individuals.

To resume, then: In the use-value of each commodity there is contained
useful labour, i.e., productive activity of a definite kind and exercised
with a definite aim. Use-values cannot confront each other as commodities,
unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in
each of them. In a community, the produce of which in general takes the
form of commodities, i.e., in a community of commodity producers, this
qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried
on independently of individual producers, each on their own account,
develops into a complex system, a social division of labour.

Anyhow, whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer, in
either case it operates as a use-value. Nor is the relation between the
coat and the labour that produced it altered by the circumstance that
tailoring may have become a special trade, an independent branch of the
social division of labour. Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it,
the human race made clothes for thousands of years, without a single man
becoming a tailor. But coats and linen, like every other element of
material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of Nature, must
invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity, exercised
with a definite aim, an activity that appropriates particular nature-given
materials to particular human wants. So far therefore as labour is a
creator of use-value, is useful labour, it is a necessary condition,
independent of all forms of society, for the existence of the human race;
it is an eternal nature-imposed necessity, without which there can be no
material exchanges between man and Nature, and therefore no life.

The use-values, coat, linen, &c., i.e., the bodies of commodities, are
combinations of two elements — matter and labour. If we take away the
useful labour expended upon them, a material substratum is always left,
which is furnished by Nature without the help of man. The latter can work
only as Nature does, that is by changing the form of matter. [13] Nay more,
in this work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural
forces. We see, then, that labour is not the only source of material
wealth, of use-values produced by labour. As William Petty puts it, labour
is its father and the earth its mother.

Let us now pass from the commodity considered as a use-value to the value
of commodities.

By our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the linen. But this
is a mere quantitative difference, which for the present does not concern
us. We bear in mind, however, that if the value of the coat is double that
of 10 yds. of linen, 20 yds. of linen must have the same value as one coat.
So far as they are values, the coat and the linen are things of a like
substance, objective expressions of essentially identical labour. But
tailoring and weaving are, qualitatively, different kinds of labour. There
are, however, states of society in which one and the same man does
tailoring and weaving alternately, in which case these two forms of labour
are mere modifications of the labour of the same individual, and no special
and fixed functions of different persons, just as the coat which our tailor
makes one day, and the trousers which he makes another day, imply only a
variation in the labour of one and the same individual. Moreover, we see at
a glance that, in our capitalist society, a given portion of human labour
is, in accordance with the varying demand, at one time supplied in the form
of tailoring, at another in the form of weaving. This change may possibly
not take place without friction, but take place it must.

Productive activity, if we leave out of sight its special form, viz., the
useful character of the labour, is nothing but the expenditure of human
labour-power. Tailoring and weaving, though qualitatively different
productive activities, are each a productive expenditure of human brains,
nerves, and muscles, and in this sense are human labour. They are but two
different modes of expending human labour-power. Of course, this
labour-power, which remains the same under all its modifications, must have
attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in a
multiplicity of modes. But the value of a commodity represents human labour
in the abstract, the expenditure of human labour in general. And just as in
society, a general or a banker plays a great part, but mere man, on the
other hand, a very shabby part, [14] so here with mere human labour. It is
the expenditure of simple labour-power, i.e., of the labour-power which, on
an average, apart from any special development, exists in the organism of
every ordinary individual. Simple average labour, it is true, varies in
character in different countries and at different times, but in a
particular society it is given. Skilled labour counts only as simple labour
intensified, or rather, as multiplied simple labour, a given quantity of
skilled being considered equal to a greater quantity of simple labour.
Experience shows that this reduction is constantly being made. A commodity
may be the product of the most skilled labour, but its value, by equating
it to the product of simple unskilled labour, represents a definite
quantity of the latter labour alone. [15] The different proportions in
which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their
standard. are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs
of the producers, and, consequently, appear to be fixed by custom. For
simplicity's sake we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be
unskilled, simple labour; by this we do no more than save ourselves the
trouble of making the reduction.

Just as, therefore, in viewing the coat and linen as values, we abstract
from their different use-values, so it is with the labour represented by
those values: we disregard the difference between its useful forms, weaving
and tailoring. As the use-values, coat and linen, are combinations of
special productive activities with cloth and yarn, while the values, coat
and linen, are, on the other hand, mere homogeneous congelations of
undifferentiated labour, so the labour embodied in these latter values does
not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but only
as being expenditure of human labour-power. Tailoring and weaving are
necessary factors in the creation of the use-values, coat and linen,
precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities; but
only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities, only in
so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour, do tailoring
and weaving form the substance of the values of the same articles.

Coats and linen, however, are not merely values, but values of definite
magnitude, and according to our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much
as the ten yards of linen. Whence this difference in their values? It is
owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour as the
coat, and consequently, that in the production of the latter, labour-power
must have been expended during twice the time necessary for the production
of the former.

While, therefore, with reference to use-value, the labour contained in a
commodity counts only qualitatively, with reference to value it counts only
quantitatively, and must first be reduced to human labour pure and simple.
In the former case, it is a question of How and What, in the latter of How
much? How long a time? Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity
represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it, it follows that all
commodities, when taken in certain proportions, must be equal in value.

If the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour
required for the production of a coat remains unchanged, the sum of the
values of the coats produced increases with their number. If one coat
represents x days' labour, two coats represent 2x days' labour, and so on.
But assume that the duration of the labour necessary for he production of a
coat becomes doubled or halved. In the first case one coat is worth as much
as two coats were before; in the second case, two coats are only worth as
much as one was before, although in both cases one coat renders the same
service as before. and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the same
quality. But the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered.

An increase in the quantity of use-values is an increase of material
wealth. With two coats two men can be clothed, with one coat only one man.
Nevertheless, an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a
simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value. This antagonistic movement
has its origin in the two-fold character of labour. Productive power has
reference, of course, only to labour of some useful concrete form, the
efficacy of any special productive activity during a given time being
dependent on its productiveness. Useful labour becomes, therefore, a more
or less abundant source of products, in proportion to the rise or fall of
its productiveness. On the other hand, no change in this productiveness
affects the labour represented by value. Since productive power is an
attribute of the concrete useful forms of labour, of course it can no
longer have any bearing on that labour, so soon as we make abstraction from
those concrete useful forms. However then productive power may vary, the
same labour, exercised during equal periods of time, always yields equal
amounts of value. But it will yield, during equal periods of time,
different quantities of values in use; more, if the productive power rise,
fewer, if it fall. The same change in productive power, which increases the
fruitfulness of labour, and, in consequence, the quantity of use-values
produced by that labour, will diminish the total value of this increased
quantity of use-values, provided such change shorten the total labour-time
necessary for their production; and vice versâ.

On the one hand all labour is, speaking physiologically, an expenditure of
human labour-power, and in its character of identical abstract human
labour, it creates and forms the value of commodities. On the other hand,
all labour is the expenditure of human labour-power in a special form and
with a definite aim, and in this, its character of concrete useful labour,
it produces use-values. [16]




SECTION 3

THE FORM OF VALUE OR EXCHANGE-VALUE


Commodities come into the world in the shape of use-values, articles, or
goods, such as iron, linen, corn, &c. This is their plain, homely, bodily
form. They are, however, commodities, only because they are something
two-fold, both objects of utility, and, at the same time, depositories of
value. They manifest themselves therefore as commodities, or have the form
of commodities, only in so far as they have two forms, a physical or
natural form, and a value-form.

The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame
Quickly, that we don't know "where to have it." The value of commodities is
the very opposite of the coarse materiality of their substance, not an atom
of matter enters into its composition. Turn and examine a single commodity,
by itself, as we will, yet in so far as it remains an object of value, it
seems impossible to grasp it. If, however we bear in mind that the value of
commodities has a purely social reality, and that they acquire this reality
only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one identical
social substance, viz., human labour, it follows as a matter of course,
that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to
commodity. In fact we started from exchange-value, or the exchange relation
of commodities, in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it. We
must now return to this form under which value first appeared to us.

Every one knows, if he knows nothing else, that commodities have a
value-form common to them all, and presenting a marked contrast with the
varied bodily forms of their use-values. I mean their money-form. Here,
however, a task is set us, the performance of which has never yet even been
attempted by bourgeois economy, the task of tracing the genesis of this
money-form, of developing the expression of value implied in the
value-relation of commodities, from its simplest, almost imperceptible
outline, to the dazzling money-form. By doing this we shall, at the same
time, solve the riddle presented by money.

The simplest value-relation is evidently that of one commodity to some one
other commodity of a different kind. Hence the relation between the values
of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of
a single commodity.

A. Elementary or Accidental Form Of Value

x commodity A = y commodity B, or
x commodity A is worth y commodity B.

20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or
20 Yards of linen are worth 1 coat.

1. The two poles of the expression of value. Relative form and Equivalent
form

The whole mystery of the form of value lies hidden in this elementary form.
Its analysis, therefore, is our real difficulty.

Here two different kinds of commodities (in our example the linen and the
coat), evidently play two different parts. The linen expresses its value in
the coat; the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed.
The former plays an active, the latter a passive, part. The value of the
linen is represented as relative value, or appears in relative form. The
coat officiates as equivalent, or appears in equivalent form.

The relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected,
mutually dependent and inseparable elements of the expression of value;
but, at the same time, are mutually exclusive, antagonistic extremes —
i.e., poles of the same expression. They are allotted respectively to the
two different commodities brought into relation by that expression. It is
not possible to express the value of linen in linen. 20 yards of linen = 20
yards of linen is no expression of value. On the contrary, such an equation
merely says that 20 yards of linen are nothing else than 20 yards of linen,
a definite quantity of the use-value linen. The value of the linen can
therefore be expressed only relatively — i.e., in some other commodity. The
relative form of the value of the linen pre-supposes, therefore, the
presence of some other commodity — here the coat — under the form of an
equivalent. On the other hand, the commodity that figures as the equivalent
cannot at the same time assume the relative form. That second commodity is
not the one whose value is expressed. Its function is merely to serve as
the material in which the value of the first commodity is expressed.

No doubt, the expression 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen
are worth 1 coat, implies the opposite relation. 1 coat = 20 yards of
linen, or 1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen. But, in that case, I must
reverse the equation, in order to express the value of the coat relatively;
and. so soon as I do that the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the
coat. A single commodity cannot, therefore, simultaneously assume, in the
same expression of value, both forms. The very polarity of these forms
makes them mutually exclusive.

Whether, then, a commodity assumes the relative form, or the opposite
equivalent form, depends entirely upon its accidental position in the
expression of value — that is, upon whether it is the commodity whose value
is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed.

2. The Relative Form of value

(a.) The nature and import of this form

In order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a
commodity lies hidden in the value-relation of two commodities, we must, in
the first place, consider the latter entirely apart from its quantitative
aspect. The usual mode of procedure is generally the reverse, and in the
value-relation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite
quantities of two different sorts of commodities that are considered equal
to each other. It is apt to be forgotten that the magnitudes of different
things can be compared quantitatively, only when those magnitudes are
expressed in terms of the same unit. It is only as expressions of such a
unit that they are of the same denomination, and therefore commensurable.

Whether 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 20 coats or = x coats-that is,
whether a given quantity of linen is worth few or many coats, every such
statement implies that the linen and coats, as magnitudes of value, are
expressions of the same unit, things of the same kind. Linen = coat is the
basis of the equation.

But the two commodities whose identity of quality is thus assumed, do not
play the same part. It is only the value of the linen that is expressed.
And how? By its reference to the coat as its equivalent, as something that
can be exchanged for it. In this relation the coat is the mode of existence
of value, is value embodied, for only as such is it the same as the linen.
On the other hand, the linen's own value comes to the front, receives
independent expression, for it is only as being value that it is comparable
with the coat as a thing of equal value, or exchangeable with the coat. To
borrow an illustration from chemistry, butyric acid is a different
substance from propyl formate. Yet both are made up of the same chemical
substances, carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), and that, too, in
like proportions — namely, C4H8O2. If now we equate butyric acid to propyl
formate, then, in the first place, propyl formate would be, in this
relation, merely a form of existence of C4H8O2; and in the second place, we
should be stating that butyric acid also consists of C4H8O2. Therefore, by
thus equating the two substances, expression would be given to their
chemical composition, while their different physical forms would be
neglected.

If we say that, as values, commodities are mere congelations of human
labour, we reduce them by our analysis, it is true, to the abstraction,
value; but we ascribe to this value no form apart from their bodily form.
It is otherwise in the value-relation of one commodity to another. Here,
the one stands forth in its character of value by reason of its relation to
the other.

By making the coat the equivalent of the linen, we equate the labour
embodied in the former to that in the latter. Now, it is true that the
tailoring, which makes the coat, is concrete labour of a different sort
from the weaving which makes the linen. But the act of equating it to the
weaving, reduces the tailoring to that which is really equal in the two
kinds of labour, to their common character of human labour. In this
roundabout way, then, the fact is expressed, that weaving also, in so far
as it weaves value, has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring, and,
consequently, is abstract human labour. It is the expression of equivalence
between different sorts of commodities that alone brings into relief the
specific character of value-creating labour, and this it does by actually
reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds
of commodities to their common quality of human labour in the abstract.
[18]

There is, however, something else required beyond the expression of the
specific character of the labour of which the value of the linen consists.
Human labour-power in motion, or human labour, creates value, but is not
itself value. It becomes value only in its congealed state, when embodied
in the form of some object. In order to express the value of the linen as a
congelation of human labour, that value must be expressed as having
objective existence, as being a something materially different from the
linen itself, and yet a something common to the linen and all other
commodities. The problem is already solved.

When occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value, the
coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen, as something of the
same kind, because it is value. In this position it is a thing in which we
see nothing but value, or whose palpable bodily form represents value. Yet
the coat itself, the body of the commodity, coat, is a mere use-value. A
coat as such no more tells us it is value, than does the first piece of
linen we take hold of. This shows that when placed in value-relation to the
linen, the coat signifies more than when out of that relation, just as many
a man strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in
mufti.

In the production of the coat, human labour-power, in the shape of
tailoring, must have been actually expended. Human labour is therefore
accumulated in it. In this aspect the coat is a depository of value, but
though worn to a thread, it does not let this fact show through. And as
equivalent of the linen in the value equation, it exists under this aspect
alone, counts therefore as embodied value, as a body that is value. A, for
instance, cannot be "your majesty" to B, unless at the same time majesty in
B's eyes assumes the bodily form of A, and, what is more, with every new
father of the people, changes its features, hair, and many other things
besides.

Hence, in the value equation, in which the coat is the equivalent of the
linen, the coat officiates as the form of value. The value of the commodity
linen is expressed by the bodily form of the commodity coat, the value of
one by the use-value of the other. As a use-value, the linen is something
palpably different from the coat; as value, it is the same as the coat, and
now has the appearance of a coat. Thus the linen acquires a value-form
different from its physical form. The fact that it is value, is made
manifest by its equality with the coat, just as the sheep's nature of a
Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God.

We see, then, all that our analysis of the value of commodities has already
told us, is told us by the linen itself, so soon as it comes into
communication with another commodity, the coat. Only it betrays its
thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar, the language of
commodities. In order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in
its abstract character of human labour, it says that the coat, in so far as
it is worth as much as the linen, and therefore is value, consists of the
same labour as the linen. In order to inform us that its sublime reality as
value is not the same as its buckram body, it says that value has the
appearance of a coat, and consequently that so far as the linen is value,
it and the coat are as like as two peas. We may here remark, that the
language of commodities has, besides Hebrew, many other more or less
correct dialects. The German "Wertsein," to be worth, for instance,
expresses in a less striking manner than the Romance verbs "valere,"
"valer," "valoir," that the equating of commodity B to commodity A, is
commodity A's own mode of expressing its value. Paris vaut bien une messe.

By means, therefore, of the value-relation expressed in our equation, the
bodily form of commodity B becomes the value-form of commodity A, or the
body of commodity B acts as a mirror to the value of commodity A. [19] By
putting itself in relation with commodity B, as value in propria personâ,
as the matter of which human labour is made up, the commodity A converts
the value in use, B, into the substance in which to express its, A's, own
value. The value of A, thus expressed in the use-value of B, has taken the
form of relative value.

(b.) Quantitative determination of Relative value

Every commodity, whose value it is intended to express, is a useful object
of given quantity, as 15 bushels of corn, or 100 Ibs. of coffee. And a
given quantity of any commodity contains a definite quantity of human
labour. The value-form must therefore not only express value generally, but
also value in definite quantity. Therefore, in the value-relation of
commodity A to commodity B, of the linen to the coat, not only is the
latter, as value in general, made the equal in quality of the linen, but a
definite quantity of coat (1 coat) is made the equivalent of a definite
quantity (20 yards) of linen.

The equation, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth
one coat, implies that the same quantity of value-substance (congealed
labour) is embodied in both; that the two commodities have each cost the
same amount of labour of the same quantity of labour-time. But the
labour-time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat
varies with every change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring. We
have now to consider the influence of such changes on the quantitative
aspect of the relative expression of value.

I. Let the value of the linen vary, [20] that of the coat remaining
constant. If, say in consequence of the exhaustion of flax-growing soil,
the labour-time necessary for the production of the linen be doubled, the
value of the linen will also be doubled. Instead of the equation, 20 yards
of linen = 1 coat, we should have 20 yards of linen = 2 coats, since 1 coat
would now contain only half the labour-time embodied in 20 yards of linen.
If, on the other hand, in consequence, say, of improved looms, this
labour-time be reduced by one-half, the value of the linen would fall by
one-half. Consequently, we should have 20 yards of linen = 1/2 coat. The
relative value of commodity A, i.e., its value expressed in commodity B,
rises and falls directly as the value of A, the value of B being supposed
constant.

II. Let the value of the linen remain constant, while the value of the coat
varies. If, under these circumstances, in consequence, for instance, of a
poor crop of wool, the labour-time necessary for the production of a coat
becomes doubled, we have instead of 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, 20 yards of
linen = 1/2 coat. If, on the other hand, the value of the coat sinks by
one-half, then 20 yards of linen = 2 coats. Hence, if the value of
commodity A remain constant, its relative value expressed in commodity B
rises and falls inversely as the value of B.

If we compare the different cases in I. and II., we see that the same
change of magnitude in relative value may arise from totally opposite
causes. Thus, the equation, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, becomes 20 yards of
linen = 2 coats, either, because the value of the linen has doubled, or
because the value of the coat has fallen by one-half; and it becomes 20
yards of linen = 1/2 coat, either, because the value of the linen has
fallen by one-half, or because the value of the coat has doubled.

III. Let the quantities of labour-time respectively necessary for the
production of the linen and the coat vary simultaneously in the same
direction and in the same proportion. In this case 20 yards of linen
continue equal to 1 coat, however much their values may have altered. Their
change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third
commodity, whose value has remained constant. If the values of all
commodities rose or fell simultaneously, and in the same proportion, their
relative values would remain unaltered. Their real change of value would
appear from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in
a given time.

IV. The labour-time respectively necessary for the production of the linen
and the coat, and therefore the value of these commodities may
simultaneously vary in the same direction, but at unequal rates or in
opposite directions, or in other ways. The effect of all these possible
different variations, on the relative value of a commodity, may be deduced
from the results of I., II., and III.

Thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor
exhaustively reflected in their relative expression, that is, in the
equation expressing the magnitude of relative value. The relative value of
a commodity may vary, although its value remains constant. Its relative
value may remain constant, although its value varies; and finally,
simultaneous variations in the magnitude of value and in that of its
relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in amount. [21]

3. The Equivalent form of value

We have seen that commodity A (the linen), by expressing its value in the
use-value of a commodity differing in kind (the coat), at the same time
impresses upon the latter a specific form of value, namely that of the
equivalent. The commodity linen manifests its quality of having a value by
the fact that the coat, without having assumed a value-form different from
its bodily form, is equated to the linen. The fact that the latter
therefore has a value is expressed by saying that the coat is directly
exchangeable with it. Therefore, when we say that a commodity is in the
equivalent form, we express the fact that it is directly exchangeable with
other commodities.

When one commodity, such as a coat, serves as the equivalent of another,
such as linen, and coats consequently acquire the characteristic property
of being directly exchangeable with linen, we are far from knowing in what
proportion the two are exchangeable. The value of the linen being given in
magnitude, that proportion depends on the value of the coat. Whether the
coat serves as the equivalent and the linen as relative value, or the linen
as the equivalent and the coat as relative value, the magnitude of the
coat's value is determined, independently of its value-form, by the
labour-time necessary for its production. But whenever the coat assumes in
the equation of value, the position of equivalent, its value acquires no
quantitative expression; on the contrary, the commodity coat now figures
only as a definite quantity of some article.

For instance, 40 yards of linen are worth — what? 2 coats. Because the
commodity coat here plays the part of equivalent, because the use-value
coat, as opposed to the linen, figures as an embodiment of value, therefore
a definite number of coats suffices to express the definite quantity of
value in the linen. Two coats may therefore express the quantity of value
of 40 yards of linen, but they can never express the quantity of their own
value. A superficial observation of this fact, namely, that in the equation
of value, the equivalent figures exclusively as a simple quantity of some
article, of some use-value, has misled Bailey, as also many others, both
before and after him, into seeing, in the expression of value, merely a
quantitative relation. The truth being, that when a commodity acts as
equivalent, no quantitative determination of its value is expressed.

The first peculiarity that strikes us, in considering the form of the
equivalent, is this: use-value becomes the form of manifestation, the
phenomenal form of its opposite, value.

The bodily form of the commodity becomes its value-form. But, mark well,
that this quid pro quo exists in the case of any commodity B, only when
some other commodity A enters into a value-relation with it, and then only
within the limits of this relation. Since no commodity can stand in the
relation of equivalent to itself, and thus turn its own bodily shape into
the expression of its own value, every commodity is compelled to choose
some other commodity for its equivalent, and to accept the use-value, that
is to say, the bodily shape of that other commodity as the form of its own
value.

One of the measures that we apply to commodities as material substances, as
use-values, will serve to illustrate this point. A sugar-loaf being a body,
is heavy, and therefore has weight: but we can neither see nor touch this
weight. We then take various pieces of iron, whose weight has been
determined beforehand. The iron, as iron, is no more the form of
manifestation of weight, than is the sugar-loaf. Nevertheless, in order to
express the sugar-loaf as so much weight, we put it into a weight-relation
with the iron. In this relation, the iron officiates as a body representing
nothing but weight. A certain quantity of iron therefore serves as the
measure of the weight of the sugar, and represents, in relation to the
sugar-loaf, weight embodied, the form of manifestation of weight. This part
is played by the iron only within this relation, into which the sugar or
any other body, whose weight has to be determined, enters with the iron.
Were they not both heavy, they could not enter into this relation, and the
one could therefore not serve as the expression of the weight of the other.
When we throw both into the scales, we see in reality, that as weight they
are both the same, and that, therefore, when taken in proper proportions,
they have the same weight. Just as the substance iron, as a measure of
weight, represents in relation to the sugar-loaf weight alone, so, in our
expression of value, the material object, coat, in relation to the linen,
represents value alone.

Here, however, the analogy ceases. The iron, in the expression of the
weight of the sugar-loaf, represents a natural property common to both
bodies, namely their weight; but the coat, in the expression of value of
the linen, represents a non-natural property of both, something purely
social, namely, their value.

Since the relative form of value of a commodity — the linen, for example —
expresses the value of that commodity, as being something wholly different
from its substance and properties, as being, for instance, coat-like, we
see that this expression itself indicates that some social relation lies at
the bottom of it. With the equivalent form it is just the contrary. The
very essence of this form is that the material commodity itself — the coat
— just as it is, expresses value, and is endowed with the form of value by
Nature itself. Of course this holds good only so long as the value-relation
exists, in which the coat stands in the position of equivalent to the
linen. [22] Since, however, the properties of a thing are not the result of
its relations to other things, but only manifest themselves in such
relations, the coat seems to be endowed with its equivalent form, its
property of being directly exchangeable, just as much by Nature as it is
endowed with the property of being heavy, or the capacity to keep us warm.
Hence the enigmatical character of the equivalent form which escapes the
notice of the bourgeois political economist, until this form, completely
developed, confronts him in the shape of money. He then seeks to explain
away the mystical character of gold and silver, by substituting for them
less dazzling commodities, and by reciting, with ever renewed satisfaction,
the catalogue of all possible commodities which at one time or another have
played the part of equivalent. He has not the least suspicion that the most
simple expression of value, such as 20 yds. of linen = 1 coat, already
propounds the riddle of the equivalent form for our solution.

The body of the commodity that serves as the equivalent, figures as the
materialisation of human labour in the abstract, and is at the same time
the product of some specifically useful concrete labour. This concrete
labour becomes, therefore, the medium for expressing abstract human labour.
If on the one hand the coat ranks as nothing but the embodiment of abstract
human labour, so, on the other hand, the tailoring which is actually
embodied in it, counts as nothing but the form under which that abstract
labour is realised. In the expression of value of the linen, the utility of
the tailoring consists, not in making clothes, but in making an object,
which we at once recognise to be Value, and therefore to be a congelation
of labour, but of labour indistinguishable from that realised in the value
of the linen. In order to act as such a mirror of value, the labour of
tailoring must reflect nothing besides its own abstract quality of being
human labour generally.

In tailoring, as well as in weaving, human labour-power is expended. Both,
therefore, possess the general property of being human labour, and may,
therefore, in certain cases, such as in the production of value, have to be
considered under this aspect alone. There is nothing mysterious in this.
But in the expression of value there is a complete turn of the tables. For
instance, how is the fact to be expressed that weaving creates the value of
the linen, not by virtue of being weaving, as such, but by reason of its
general property of being human labour? Simply by opposing to weaving that
other particular form of concrete labour (in this instance tailoring),
which produces the equivalent of the product of weaving. Just as the coat
in its bodily form became a direct expression of value, so now does
tailoring, a concrete form of labour, appear as the direct and palpable
embodiment of human labour generally.

Hence, the second peculiarity of the equivalent form is, that concrete
labour becomes the form under which its opposite, abstract human labour,
manifests itself.

But because this concrete labour, tailoring in our case, ranks as, and is
directly identified with, undifferentiated human labour, it also ranks as
identical with any other sort of labour, and therefore with that embodied
in the linen. Consequently, although, like all other commodity producing
labour, it is the labour of private individuals, yet, at the same time, it
ranks as labour directly social in its character. This is the reason why it
results in a product directly exchangeable with other commodities. We have
then a third peculiarity of the equivalent form, namely, that the labour of
private individuals takes the form of its opposite, labour directly social
in its form.

The two latter peculiarities of the equivalent form will become more
intelligible if we go back to the great thinker who was the first to
analyse so many forms, whether of thought, society, or Nature, and amongst
them also the form of value. I mean Aristotle.

In the first place, he clearly enunciates that the money-form of
commodities is only the further development of the simple form of value-
i.e., of the expression of the value of one commodity in some other
commodity taken at random; for he says:

5 beds = 1 house
(clinai pente anti oiciaV)

is not to be distinguished from

5 beds = so much money.
(clinai pente anti . . . dson ai pente clinai)

He further sees that the value-relation which gives rise to this expression
makes it necessary that the house should qualitatively be made the equal of
the bed, and that, without such an equalisation, these two clearly
different things could not be compared with each other as commensurable
quantities. "Exchange," he says, "cannot take place without equality, and
equality not without commensurability". (out isothV mh oushV snmmetriaV).
Here, however, he comes to a stop, and gives up the further analysis of the
form of value. "It is, however, in reality, impossible (th men oun alhqeia
adunaton), that such unlike things can be commensurable" — i.e.,
qualitatively equal. Such an equalisation can only be something foreign to
their real nature, consequently only "a makeshift for practical purposes."

Aristotle therefore, himself, tells us, what barred the way to his further
analysis; it was the absence of any concept of value. What is that equal
something, that common substance, which admits of the value of the beds
being expressed by a house? Such a thing, in truth, cannot exist, says
Aristotle. And why not? Compared with the beds, the house does represent
something equal to them, in so far as it represents what is really equal,
both in the beds and the house. And that is — human labour.

There was, however, an important fact which prevented Aristotle from seeing
that, to attribute value to commodities, is merely a mode of expressing all
labour as equal human labour, and consequently as labour of equal quality.
Greek society was founded upon slavery, and had, therefore, for its natural
basis, the inequality of men and of their labour-powers. The secret of the
expression of value, namely, that all kinds of labour are equal and
equivalent, because, and so far as they are human labour in general, cannot
be deciphered, until the notion of human equality has already acquired the
fixity of a popular prejudice. This, however, is possible only in a society
in which the great mass of the produce of labour takes the form of
commodities, in which, consequently, the dominant relation between man and
man, is that of owners of commodities. The brilliancy of Aristotle's genius
is shown by this alone, that he discovered, in the expression of the value
of commodities, a relation of equality. The peculiar conditions of the
society in which he lived, alone prevented him from discovering what, "in
truth," was at the bottom of this equality.

4. The Elementary Form of value considered as a whole

The elementary form of value of a commodity is contained in the equation,
expressing its value-relation to another commodity of a different kind, or
in its exchange-relation to the-same. The value of commodity A, is
qualitatively expressed, by the fact that commodity B is directly
exchangeable with it. Its value is quantitatively expressed by the fact,
that a definite quantity of B is exchangeable with a definite quantity of
A. In other words, the value of a commodity obtains independent and
definite expression, by taking the form of exchange-value. When, at the
beginning of this chapter, we said, in common parlance, that a commodity is
both a use-value and an exchange-value, we were, accurately speaking,
wrong. A commodity is a use-value or object of utility, and a value. It
manifests itself as this two-fold thing, that it is, as soon as its value
assumes an independent form — viz., the form of exchange-value. It never
assumes this form when isolated, but only when placed in a value or
exchange relation with another commodity of a different kind. When once we
know this, such a mode of expression does no harm; it simply serves as an
abbreviation.

Our analysis has shown, that the form or expression of the value of a
commodity originates in the nature of value, and not that value and its
magnitude originate in the mode of their expression as exchange-value.
This, however, is the delusion as well of the mercantilists and their
recent revivers, Ferrier, Ganilh, [23] and others, as also of their
antipodes, the modern bagmen of Free-trade, such as Bastiat. The
mercantilists lay special stress on the qualitative aspect of the
expression of value, and consequently on the equivalent form of
commodities, which attains its full perfection in money. The modern hawkers
of Free-trade, who must get rid of their article at any price, on the other
hand, lay most stress on the quantitative aspect of the relative form of
value. For them there consequently exists neither value, nor magnitude of
value, anywhere except in its expression by means of the exchange relation
of commodities, that is, in the daily list of prices current. Macleod, who
has taken upon himself to dress up the confused ideas of Lombard Street in
the most learned finery, is a successful cross between the superstitious
mercantilists, and the enlightened Free-trade bagmen.

A close scrutiny of the expression of the value of A in terms of B,
contained in the equation expressing the value-relation of A to B, has
shown us that, within that relation, the bodily form of A figures only as a
use-value, the bodily form of B only as the form or aspect of value. The
opposition or contrast existing internally in each commodity between
use-value and value, is, therefore, made evident externally by two
commodities being placed in such relation to each other, that the commodity
whose value it is sought to express, figures directly as a mere use-value,
while the commodity in which that value is to be expressed, figures
directly as mere exchange-value. Hence the elementary form of value of a
commodity is the elementary form in which the contrast contained in that
commodity, between use-value and value, becomes apparent.

Every product of labour is, in all states of society, a use-value; but it
is only at a definite historical epoch in a society's development that such
a product becomes a commodity, viz., at the epoch when the labour spent on
the production of a useful article becomes expressed as one of the
objective qualities of that article, i.e., as its value. It therefore
follows that the elementary value-form is also the primitive form under
which a product of labour appears historically as a commodity, and that the
gradual transformation of such products into commodities, proceeds pari
passu with the development of the value-form.

We perceive, at first sight, the deficiencies of the elementary form of
value: it is a mere germ, which must undergo a series of metamorphoses
before it can ripen into the price-form.

The expression of the value of commodity A in terms of any other commodity
B, merely distinguishes the value from the use-value of A, and therefore
places A merely in a relation of exchange with a single different
commodity, B; but it is still far from expressing A's qualitative equality,
and quantitative proportionality, to all commodities. To the elementary
relative value-form of a commodity, there corresponds the single equivalent
form of one other commodity. Thus, in the relative expression of value of
the linen, the coat assumes the form of equivalent, or of being directly
exchangeable, only in relation to a single commodity, the linen.

Nevertheless, the elementary form of value passes by an easy transition
into a more complete form. It is true that by means of the elementary form,
the value of a commodity A, becomes expressed in terms of one, and only
one, other commodity. But that one may be a commodity of any kind, coat,
iron, corn, or anything else. Therefore, according as A is placed in
relation with one or the other, we get for one and the same commodity,
different elementary expressions of value. [24] The number of such possible
expressions is limited only by the number of the different kinds of
commodities distinct from it. The isolated expression of A's value, is
therefore convertible into a series, prolonged to any length, of the
different elementary expressions of that value.

               =  v Com. C  or

               =  w Com. D  or

               =  Com. E    or

               =  &c.       or

      (20 yards of linen = 1 coat          or

                         = 10 lbs. tea     or

                         = 40 lbs. coffee  or

                         = quarter corn    or

                         = 2 ounces gold   or

                         = 1/2 ton iron    or

                         = &c.)            or

1. The Expanded Relative form of value

The value of a single commodity, the linen, for example, is now expressed
in terms of numberless other elements of the world of commodities. Every
other commodity now becomes a mirror of the linen's value. [25] It is thus,
that for the first time, this value shows itself in its true light as a
congelation of undifferentiated human labour. For the labour that creates
it, now stands expressly revealed, as labour that ranks equally with every
other sort of human labour, no matter what its form, whether tailoring,
ploughing, mining, &c., and no matter, therefore, whether it is realised in
coats, corn, iron, or gold. The linen, by virtue of the form of its value,
now stands in a social relation, no longer with only one other kind of
commodity, but with the whole world of commodities. As a commodity, it is a
citizen of that world. At the same time, the interminable series of value
equations implies, that as regards the value of a commodity, it is a matter
of indifference under what particular form, or kind, of use-value it
appears.

In the first form, 20 yds. of linen = 1 coat, it might, for ought that
otherwise appears, be pure accident, that these two commodities are
exchangeable in definite quantities. In the second form, on the contrary,
we perceive at once the background that determines, and is essentially
different from, this accidental appearance. The value of the linen remains
unaltered in magnitude, whether expressed in coats, coffee, or iron, or in
numberless different commodities, the property of as many different owners.
The accidental relation between two individual commodity-owners disappears.
It becomes plain, that it is not the exchange of commodities which
regulates the magnitude of their value; but, on the contrary, that it is
the magnitude of their value which controls their exchange proportions.

2. The particular Equivalent form

Each commodity, such as, coat, tea, corn, iron, &c., figures in the
expression of value of the linen, as an equivalent, and, consequently, as a
thing that is value. The bodily form of each of these commodities figures
now as a particular equivalent form, one out of many. In the same way the
manifold concrete useful kinds of labour, embodied in these different
commodities, rank now as so many different forms of the realisation, or
manifestation, of undifferentiated human labour.

3. Defects of the Total or Expanded form of value

In the first place, the relative expression of value is incomplete because
the series representing it is interminable. The chain of which each
equation of value is a link, is liable at any moment to be lengthened by
each new kind of commodity that comes into existence and furnishes the
material for a fresh expression of value. In the second place, it is a
many-coloured mosaic of disparate and independent expressions of value. And
lastly, if, as must be the case, the relative value of each commodity in
turn, becomes expressed in this expanded form, we get for each of them a
relative value-form, different in every case, and consisting of an
interminable series of expressions of value. The defects of the expanded
relative value-form are reflected in the corresponding equivalent form.
Since the bodily form of each single commodity is one particular equivalent
form amongst numberless others, we have, on the whole, nothing but
fragmentary equivalent forms, each excluding the others. In the same way,
also, the special, concrete, useful kind of labour embodied in each
particular equivalent, is presented only as a particular kind of labour,
and therefore not as an exhaustive representative of human labour
generally. The latter, indeed, gains adequate manifestation in the totality
of its manifold, particular, concrete forms. But, in that case, its
expression in an infinite series is ever incomplete and deficient in unity.

The expanded relative value-form is, however, nothing but the sum of the
elementary relative expressions or equations of the first kind, such as:

20 yards of linen = 1 coat
20 yards of linen = 10 Ibs. of tea, etc.

Each of these implies the corresponding inverted equation,

1 coat = 20 yards of linen
10 Ibs. of tea = 20 yards of linen, etc.

In fact, when a person exchanges his linen for many other commodities, and
thus expresses its value in a series of other commodities, it necessarily
follows, that the various owners of the latter exchange them for the linen,
and consequently express the value of their various commodities in one and
the same third commodity, the linen. If then, we reverse the series, 20
yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 Ibs. of tea, etc., that is to say, if we
give expression to the converse relation already implied in the series, we
get,

C. The General Form of Value

      1 coat

      10 Ibs. of tea

      40 lbs. of coffee

      1 quarter of corn     =   20 yards of linen

      2 ounces of gold

      1/2 a ton of iron

      x Commodity A., etc.

1. The altered character of the form of value

All commodities now express their value (1) in an elementary form, because
in a single commodity; (2) with unity, because in one and the same
commodity. This form of value is elementary and the same for all, therefore
general.

The forms A and B were fit only to express the value of a commodity as
something distinct from its use-value or material form.

The first- form, A, furnishes such equations as the following:

1 coat = 20 yards of linen,
10 lbs. of tea = 1/2 a ton of iron.

The value of the coat is equated to linen, that of the tea to iron. But to
be equated to linen, and again to iron, is to be as different as are linen
and iron. This forms it is plain, occurs practically only in the first
beginning, when the products of labour are converted into commodities by
accidental and occasional exchanges.

The second form, B, distinguishes, in a more adequate manner than the
first, the value of a commodity from its use-value, for the value of the
coat is there placed in contrast under all possible shapes with the bodily
form of the coat; it is equated to linen, to iron, to tea, in short, to
everything else, only not to itself, the coat. On the other hand, any
general expression of value common to all is directly excluded; for, in the
equation of value of each commodity, all other commodities now appear only
under the form of equivalents. The expanded form of value comes into actual
existence for the first time so soon as a particular product of labour,
such as cattle, is no longer exceptionally, but habitually, exchanged for
various other commodities.

The third and lastly developed form expresses the values of the whole world
of commodities in terms of a single commodity set apart for the purpose,
namely, the linen, and thus represents to us their values by means of their
equality with linen. The value of every commodity is now, by being equated
to linen, not only differentiated from its own use-value, but from all
other use-values generally, and is, by that very fact, expressed as that
which is common to all commodities. By this form, commodities are, for the
first time, effectively brought into relation with one another as values,
or made to appear as exchange-values.

The two earlier forms either express the value of each commodity in terms
of a single commodity of a different kind, or in a series of many such
commodities. In both cases, it is, so to say, the special business of each
single commodity to find an expression for its value, and this it does
without the help of the others. These others, with respect to the former,
play the passive parts of equivalents. The general form of value, C,
results from the joint action of the whole world of commodities, and from
that alone. A commodity can acquire a general expression of its value only
by all other commodities, simultaneously with it, expressing their values
in the same equivalent; and every new commodity must follow suit. It thus
becomes evident that since the existence of commodities as values is purely
social, this social existence can be expressed by the totality of their
social relations alone, and consequently that the form of their value must
be a socially recognised form.

All commodities being equated to linen now appear not only as qualitatively
equal as values generally, but also as values whose magnitudes are capable
of comparison. By expressing the magnitudes of their values in one and the
same material, the linen, those magnitudes are also compared with each
other For instance, 10 Ibs. of tea = 20 yards of linen, and 40 lbs. of
coffee = 20 yards of linen. Therefore, 10 Ibs of tea = 40 Ibs. of coffee.
In other words, there is contained in 1 lb. of coffee only one-fourth as
much substance of value — labour — as is contained in 1 lb. of tea.

The general form of relative value, embracing the whole world of
commodities, converts the single commodity that is excluded from the rest,
and made to play the part of equivalent — here the linen — into the
universal equivalent. The bodily form of the linen is now the form assumed
in common by the values of all commodities; it therefore becomes directly
exchangeable with all and every of them. The substance linen becomes the
visible incarnation, the social chrysalis state of every kind of human
labour. Weaving, which is the labour of certain private individuals
producing a particular article, linen, acquires in consequence a social
character, the character of equality with all other kinds of labour. The
innumerable equations of which the general form of value is composed,
equate in turn the labour embodied in the linen to that embodied in every
other commodity, and they thus convert weaving into the general form of
manifestation of undifferentiated human labour. In this manner the labour
realised in the values of commodities is presented not only under its
negative aspect, under which abstraction is made from every concrete form
and useful property of actual work, but its own positive nature is made to
reveal itself expressly. The general value-form is the reduction of all
kinds of actual labour to their common character of being human labour
generally, of being the expenditure of human labour-power.

The general value-form, which represents all products of labour as mere
congelations of undifferentiated human labour, shows by its very structure
that it is the social resume of the world of commodities. That form
consequently makes it indisputably evident that in the world of commodities
the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its
specific social character.

2. The Interdependent Development of the Relative Form of Value, and of the
Equivalent Form

The degree of development of the relative form of value corresponds to that
of the equivalent form. But we must bear in mind that the development of
the latter is only the expression and result of the development of the
former.

The primary or isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts
some other commodity into an isolated equivalent. The expanded form of
relative value, which is the expression of the value of one commodity in
terms of all other commodities, endows those other commodities with the
character of particular equivalents differing in kind. And lastly, a
particular kind of commodity acquires the character of universal
equivalent, because all other commodities make it the material in which
they uniformly express their value.

The antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form,
the two poles of the value-form, is developed concurrently with that form
itself.

The first form, 20 yds. of linen = one coat, already contains this
antagonism, without as yet fixing it. According as we read this equation
forwards or backwards, the parts played by the linen and the coat are
different. In the one case the relative value of the linen is expressed in
the coat, in the other case the relative value of the coat is expressed in
the linen. In this first form of value, therefore, it is difficult to grasp
the polar contrast.

Form B shows that only one single commodity at a time can completely expand
its relative value, and that it acquires this expanded form only because,
and in so far as, all other commodities are, with respect to it,
equivalents. Here we cannot reverse the equation, as we can the equation 20
yds. of linen = 1 coat, without altering its general character, and
converting it from the expanded form of value into the general form of
value.

Finally, the form C gives to the world of commodities a general social
relative form of value, because, and in so far as, thereby all commodities,
with the exception of one, are excluded from the equivalent form. A single
commodity, the linen, appears therefore to have acquired the character of
direct exchangeability with every other commodity because, and in so far
as, this character is denied to every other commodity. [26]

The commodity that figures as universal equivalent, is, on the other hand,
excluded from the relative value-form. If the linen, or any other commodity
serving as universal equivalent, were, at the same time, to share in the
relative form of value, it would have to serve as its own equivalent. We
should then have 20 yds. of linen = 20 yds. of linen; this tautology
expresses neither value, nor magnitude of value. In order to express the
relative value of the universal equivalent, we must rather reverse the form
C. This equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other
commodities, but its value is relatively expressed by a never ending series
of other commodities.

Thus, the expanded form of relative value, or form B, now shows itself as
the specific form of relative value for the equivalent commodity.

3. Transition from the General Form of Value to the Money-Form

The universal equivalent form is a form of value in general. It can,
therefore, be assumed by any commodity. On the other hand, if a commodity
be found to have assumed the universal equivalent form (form C), this is
only because and in so far as it has been excluded from the rest of all
other commodities as their equivalent, and that by their own act. And from
the moment that this exclusion becomes finally restricted to one particular
commodity, from that moment only, the general form of relative value of the
world of commodities obtains real consistence and general social validity.

The particular commodity, with whose bodily form the equivalent form is
thus socially identified, now becomes the money-commodity, or serves as
money. It becomes the special social function of that commodity, and
consequently its social monopoly, to play within the world of commodities
the part of the universal equivalent. Amongst the commodities which, in
form B, figure as particular equivalents of the linen, and, in form C,
express in common their relative values in linen, this foremost place has
been attained by one in particular- namely, gold. If, then, in form C we
replace the linen by gold, we get,

D. The Money-Form

      20 yards of linen

      1 coat

      10 Ibs. of tea

      40 lbs. of coffee

      1 quarter of corn     =   2 ounces of gold

      1/2 a ton of iron

      x commodity A., etc.



In passing from form A to form B, and from the latter to form C, the
changes are fundamental. On the other hand, there is no difference between
forms C and D, except that, in the latter, gold has assumed the equivalent
form in the place of linen. Gold is in form D, what linen was in form C —
the universal equivalent. The progress consists in this alone, that the
character of direct and universal exchangeability — in other words, that
the universal equivalent form — has now, by social custom, become finally
identified with the substance, gold.

Gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it
was previously, with reference to them, a simple commodity. Like all other
commodities, it was also capable of serving as an equivalent, either as
simple equivalent in isolated exchanges, or as particular equivalent by the
side of others. Gradually it began to serve, within varying limits, as
universal equivalent. So soon as it monopolises this position in the
expression of value for the world of commodities, it becomes the money
commodity, and then, and not till then, does form D become distinct from
form C, and the general form of value become changed into the money-form.

The elementary expression of the relative value of a single commodity, such
as linen, in terms of the commodity, such as gold, that plays the part of
money, is the price-form of that commodity. The price-form of the linen is
therefore

20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold, or,
if 2 ounces of gold when coined are £2, 20 yards of linen = £2.

The difficulty in forming a concept of the money-form, consists in clearly
comprehending the universal equivalent form, and as a necessary corollary,
the general form of value, form C. The latter is deducible from form B, the
expanded form of value, the essential component element of which, we saw,
is form A, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or x commodity A = y commodity B. The
simple commodity-form is therefore the germ of the money-form.




SECTION 4

THE FETISHISM OF COMMODITIES
AND THE SECRET THEREOF




A commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily
understood. Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing,
abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties. So far as it
is a value in use, there is nothing mysterious about it, whether we
consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of
satisfying human wants, or from the point that those properties are the
product of human labour. It is as clear as noon-day, that man, by his
industry, changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature, in such a
way as to make them useful to him. The form of wood, for instance, is
altered, by making a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table
continues to be that common, every-day thing, wood. But, so soon as it
steps forth as a commodity, it is changed into something transcendent. It
not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other
commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain
grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than "table-turning" ever was.

The mystical character of commodities does not originate, therefore, in
their use-value. Just as little does it proceed from the nature of the
determining factors of value. For, in the first place, however varied the
useful kinds of labour, or productive activities, may be, it is a
physiological fact, that they are functions of the human organism, and that
each such function, whatever may be its nature or form, is essentially the
expenditure of human brain, nerves, muscles, &c. Secondly, with regard to
that which forms the ground-work for the quantitative determination of
value, namely, the duration of that expenditure, or the quantity of labour,
it is quite clear that there is a palpable difference between its quantity
and quality. In all states of society, the labour-time that it costs to
produce the means of subsistence, must necessarily be an object of interest
to mankind, though not of equal interest in different stages of
development. [27] And lastly, from the moment that men in any way work for
one another, their labour assumes a social form.

Whence, then, arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour, so
soon as it assumes the form of commodities? Clearly from this form itself.
The equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their
products all being equally values; the measure of the expenditure of
labour-power by the duration of that expenditure, takes the form of the
quantity of value of the products of labour; and finally the mutual
relations of the producers, within which the social character of their
labour affirms itself, take the form of a social relation between the
products.

A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it the
social character of men's labour appears to them as an objective character
stamped upon the product of that labour; because the relation of the
producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a
social relation, existing not between themselves, but between the products
of their labour. This is the reason why the products of labour become
commodities, social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible
and imperceptible by the senses. In the same way the light from an object
is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve, but
as the objective form of something outside the eye itself. But, in the act
of seeing, there is at all events, an actual passage of light from one
thing to another, from the external object to the eye. There is a physical
relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities.
There, the existence of the things qua commodities, and the value-relation
between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have
absolutely no connexion with their physical properties and with the
material relations arising therefrom. There it is a definite social
relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a
relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must
have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world. In that
world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings
endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the
human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men's
hands. This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of
labour, so soon as they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore
inseparable from the production of commodities.

This Fetishism of commodities has its origin, as the foregoing analysis has
already shown, in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces
them.

As a general rule, articles of utility become commodities, only because
they are products of the labour of private individuals or groups of
individuals who carry on their work independently of each other. The sum
total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate
labour of society. Since the producers do not come into social contact with
each other until they exchange their products, the specific social
character of each producer's labour does not show itself except in the act
of exchange. In other words, the labour of the individual asserts itself as
a part of the labour of society, only by means of the relations which the
act of exchange establishes directly between the products, and indirectly,
through them, between the producers. To the latter, therefore, the
relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest
appear, not as direct social relations between individuals at work, but as
what they really are, material relations between persons and social
relations between things. It is only by being exchanged that the products
of labour acquire, as values, one uniform social status, distinct from
their varied forms of existence as objects of utility. This division of a
product into a useful thing and a value becomes practically important, only
when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful articles are
produced for the purpose of being exchanged, and their character as values
has therefore to be taken into account, beforehand, during production. From
this moment the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a
two-fold character. On the one hand, it must, as a definite useful kind of
labour, satisfy a definite social want, and thus hold its place as part and
parcel of the collective labour of all, as a branch of a social division of
labour that has sprung up spontaneously. On the other hand, it can satisfy
the manifold wants of the individual producer himself, only in so far as
the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an
established social fact, and therefore the private useful labour of each
producer ranks on an equality with that of all others. The equalisation of
the most different kinds of labour can be the result only of an abstraction
from their inequalities, or of reducing them to their common denominator,
viz. expenditure of human labour-power or human labour in the abstract. The
two-fold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him,
when reflected in his brain, only under those forms which are impressed
upon that labour in every-day practice by the exchange of products. In this
way, the character that his own labour possesses of being socially useful
takes the form of the condition, that the product must be not only useful,
but useful for others, and the social character that his particular labour
has of being the equal of all other particular kinds of labour, takes the
form that all the physically different articles that are the products of
labour. have one common quality, viz., that of having value.

Hence, when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each
other as values, it is not because we see in these articles the material
receptacles of homogeneous human labour. Quite the contrary: whenever, by
an exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very act,
we also equate, as human labour, the different kinds of labour expended
upon them. We are not aware of this, nevertheless we do it. [28] Value,
therefore, does not stalk about with a label describing what it is. It is
value, rather, that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic.
Later on, we try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of
our own social products; for to stamp an object of utility as a value, is
just as much a social product as language. The recent scientific discovery,
that the products of labour, so far as they are values, are but material
expressions of the human labour spent in their production, marks, indeed,
an epoch in the history of the development of the human race, but, by no
means, dissipates the mist through which the social character of labour
appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves. The
fact, that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing,
viz., the production of commodities, the specific social character of
private labour carried on independently, consists in the equality of every
kind of that labour, by virtue of its being human labour, which character,
therefore, assumes in the product the form of value — this fact appears to
the producers, notwithstanding the discovery above referred to, to be just
as real and final, as the fact, that, after the discovery by science of the
component gases of air, the atmosphere itself remained unaltered.

What, first of all, practically concerns producers when they make an
exchange, is the question, how much of some other product they get for
their own? in what proportions the products are exchangeable? When these
proportions have, by custom, attained a certain stability, they appear to
result from the nature of the products, so that, for instance, one ton of
iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a
pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of their different physical and
chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight. The character of having
value, when once impressed upon products, obtains fixity only by reason of
their acting and re-acting upon each other as quantities of value. These
quantities vary continually, independently of the will, foresight and
action of the producers. To them, their own social action takes the form of
the action of objects, which rule the producers instead of being ruled by
them. It requires a fully developed production of commodities before, from
accumulated experience alone, the scientific conviction springs up, that
all the different kinds of private labour, which are carried on
independently of each other, and yet as spontaneously developed branches of
the social division of labour, are continually being reduced to the
quantitative proportions in which society requires them. And why? Because,
in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange-relations
between the products, the labour-time socially necessary for their
production forcibly asserts itself like an over-riding law of Nature. The
law of gravity thus asserts itself when a house falls about our ears. [29]
The determination of the magnitude of value by labour-time is therefore a
secret, hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of
commodities. Its discovery, while removing all appearance of mere
accidentality from the determination of the magnitude of the values of
products, yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination takes
place.

Man's reflections on the forms of social life, and consequently, also, his
scientific analysis of those forms, take a course directly opposite to that
of their actual historical development. He begins, post festum, with the
results of the process of development ready to hand before him. The
characters that stamp products as commodities, and whose establishment is a
necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities, have already
acquired the stability of natural, self-understood forms of social life,
before man seeks to decipher, not their historical character, for in his
eyes they are immutable, but their meaning. Consequently it was the
analysis of the prices of commodities that alone led to the determination
of the magnitude of value, and it was the common expression of all
commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their
characters as values. It is, however, just this ultimate money-form of the
world of commodities that actually conceals, instead of disclosing, the
social character of private labour, and the social relations between the
individual producers. When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation
to linen, because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour,
the absurdity of the statement is self-evident. Nevertheless, when the
producers of coats and boots compare those articles with linen, or, what is
the same thing, with gold or silver, as the universal equivalent, they
express the relation between their own private labour and the collective
labour of society in the same absurd form.

The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. They are
forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and
relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production, viz.,
the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the
magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they
take the form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to
other forms of production.

Since Robinson Crusoe's experiences are a favourite theme with political
economists, [30] let us take a look at him on his island. Moderate though
he be, yet some few wants he has to satisfy, and must therefore do a little
useful work of various sorts, such as making tools and furniture, taming
goats, fishing and hunting. Of his prayers and the like we take no account,
since they are a source of pleasure to him, and he looks upon them as so
much recreation. In spite of the variety of his work, he knows that his
labour, whatever its form, is but the activity of one and the same
Robinson, and consequently, that it consists of nothing but different modes
of human labour. Necessity itself compels him to apportion his time
accurately between his different kinds of work. Whether one kind occupies a
greater space in his general activity than another, depends on the
difficulties, greater or less as the case may be, to be overcome in
attaining the useful effect aimed at. This our friend Robinson soon learns
by experience, and having rescued a watch, ledger, and pen and ink from the
wreck, commences, like a true-born Briton, to keep a set of books. His
stock-book contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him, of
the operations necessary for their production; and lastly, of the
labour-time that definite quantities of those objects have, on an average,
cost him. All the relations between Robinson and the objects that form this
wealth of his own creation, are here so simple and clear as to be
intelligible without exertion, even to Mr. Sedley Taylor. And yet those
relations contain all that is essential to the determination of value.

Let us now transport ourselves from Robinson's island bathed in light to
the European middle ages shrouded in darkness. Here, instead of the
independent man, we find everyone dependent, serfs and lords, vassals and
suzerains, laymen and clergy. Personal dependence here characterises the
social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of
life organised on the basis of that production. But for the very reason
that personal dependence forms the ground-work of society, there is no
necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different
from their reality. They take the shape, in the transactions of society, of
services in kind and payments in kind. Here the particular and natural form
of labour, and not, as in a society based on production of commodities, its
general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour. Compulsory
labour is just as properly measured by time, as commodity-producing labour;
but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord, is a
definite quantity of his own personal labour-power. The tithe to be
rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing. No matter,
then, what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of
people themselves in this society, the social relations between individuals
in the performance of their labour, appear at all events as their own
mutual personal relations, and are not disguised under the shape of social
relations between the products of labour.

For an example of labour in common or directly associated labour, we have
no occasion to go back to that spontaneously developed form which we find
on the threshold of the history of all civilised races. [31] We have one
close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family, that
produces corn, cattle, yarn, linen, and clothing for home use. These
different articles are, as regards the family, so many products of its
labour, but as between themselves, they are not commodities. The different
kinds of labour, such as tillage, cattle tending, spinning, weaving and
making clothes, which result in the various products, are in themselves,
and such as they are, direct social functions, because functions of the
family, which, just as much as a society based on the production of
commodities, possesses a spontaneously developed system of division of
labour. The distribution of the work within the family, and the regulation
of the labour-time of the several members, depend as well upon differences
of age and sex as upon natural conditions varying with the seasons. The
labour-power of each individual, by its very nature, operates in this case
merely as a definite portion of the whole labour-power of the family, and
therefore, the measure of the expenditure of individual labour-power by its
duration, appears here by its very nature as a social character of their
labour.

Let us now picture to ourselves, by way of change, a community of free
individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in common,
in which the labour-power of all the different individuals is consciously
applied as the combined labour-power of the community. All the
characteristics of Robinson's labour are here repeated, but with this
difference, that they are social, instead of individual. Everything
produced by him was exclusively the result of his own personal labour, and
therefore simply an object of use for himself. The total product of our
community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh means of
production and remains social. But another portion is consumed by the
members as means of subsistence. A distribution of this portion amongst
them is consequently necessary. The mode of this distribution will vary
with the productive organisation of the community, and the degree of
historical development attained by the producers. We will assume, but
merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities, that
the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is
determined by his labour-time. Labour-time would, in that case, play a
double part. Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan
maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be
done and the various wants of the community. On the other hand, it also
serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each
individual, and of his share in the part of the total product destined for
individual consumption. The social relations of the individual producers,
with regard both to their labour and to its products, are in this case
perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to
production but also to distribution.

The religious world is but the reflex of the real world. And for a society
based upon the production of commodities, in which the producers in general
enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as
commodities and values, whereby they reduce their individual private labour
to the standard of homogeneous human labour-for such a society,
Christianity with its cultus of abstract man, more especially in its
bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism, &c., is the most fitting form
of religion. In the ancient Asiatic and other ancient modes of production,
we find that the conversion of products into commodities, and therefore the
conversion of men into producers of commodities, holds a subordinate place,
which, however, increases in importance as the primitive communities
approach nearer and nearer to their dissolution. Trading nations, properly
so called, exist in the ancient world only in its interstices, like the
gods of Epicurus in the Intermundia, or like Jews in the pores of Polish
society. Those ancient social organisms of production are, as compared with
bourgeois society, extremely simple and transparent. But they are founded
either on the immature development of man individually, who has not yet
severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen in a
primitive tribal community, or upon direct relations of subjection. They
can arise and exist only when the development of the productive power of
labour has not risen beyond a low stage, and when, therefore, the social
relations within the sphere of material life, between man and man, and
between man and Nature, are correspondingly narrow. This narrowness is
reflected in the ancient worship of Nature, and in the other elements of
the popular religions. The religious reflex of the real world can, in any
case, only then finally vanish, when the practical relations of every-day
life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations
with regard to his fellowmen and to Nature.

The life-process of society, which is based on the process of material
production, does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as
production by freely associated men, and is consciously regulated by them
in accordance with a settled plan. This, however, demands for society a
certain material ground-work or set of conditions of existence which in
their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of
development.

Political Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, [32] value and
its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has
never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its
product and labour-time by the magnitude of that value. [33] These
formulae, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they
belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the
mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulae appear
to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed
by Nature as productive labour itself. Hence forms of social production
that preceded the bourgeois form, are treated by the bourgeoisie in much
the same way as the Fathers of the Church treated pre-Christian religions.
[34]

To what extent some economists are misled by the Fetishism inherent in
commodities, or by the objective appearance of the social characteristics
of labour, is shown, amongst other ways, by the dull and tedious quarrel
over the part played by Nature in the formation of exchange-value. Since
exchange-value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of
labour bestowed upon an object, Nature has no more to do with it, than it
has in fixing the course of exchange.

The mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity,
or is produced directly for exchange, is the most general and most
embryonic form of bourgeois production. It therefore makes its appearance
at an early date in history, though not in the same predominating and
characteristic manner as now-a-days. Hence its Fetish character is
comparatively easy to be seen through. But when we come to more concrete
forms, even this appearance of simplicity vanishes. Whence arose the
illusions of the monetary system? To it gold and silver, when serving as
money, did not represent a social relation between producers, but were
natural objects with strange social properties. And modern economy, which
looks down with such disdain on the monetary system, does not its
superstition come out as clear as noon-day, whenever it treats of capital?
How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion, that
rents grow out of the soil and not out of society?

But not to anticipate, we will content ourselves with yet another example
relating to the commodity-form. Could commodities themselves speak, they
would say: Our use-value may be a thing that interests men. It is no part
of us as objects. What, however, does belong to us as objects, is our
value. Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it. In the eyes of
each other we are nothing but exchange-values. Now listen how those
commodities speak through the mouth of the economist. "Value" — (i.e.,
exchange-value) "is a property of things, riches" — (i.e., use-value) "of
man. Value, in this sense, necessarily implies exchanges, riches do not."
[35] "Riches" (use-value) "are the attribute of men, value is the attribute
of commodities. A man or a community is rich, a pearl or a diamond is
valuable... A pearl or a diamond is valuable" as a pearl or a diamond. [36]
So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange-value either in a pearl or a
diamond. The economic discoverers of this chemical element, who by-the-by
lay special claim to critical acumen, find however that the use-value of
objects belongs to them independently of their material properties, while
their value, on the other hand, forms a part of them as objects. What
confirms them in this view, is the peculiar circumstance that the use-value
of objects is realised without exchange, by means of a direct relation
between the objects and man, while, on the other hand, their value is
realised only by exchange, that is, by means of a social process. Who fails
here to call to mind our good friend, Dogberry, who informs neighbour
Seacoal, that, "To be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but
reading and writing comes by Nature." [37]

[15] The reader must note that we are not speaking here of the wages or
value that the labourer gets for a given labour-time, but of the value of
the commodity in which that labour-time is materialised. Wages is a
category that, as yet, has no existence at the present stage of our
investigation.

[16] In order to prove that labour alone is that all-sufficient and real
measure, by which at all times the value of all commodities can be
estimated and compared, Adam Smith says, "Equal quantities of labour must
at all times and in all places have the same value for the labourer. In his
normal state of health, strength, and activity, and with the average degree
of skill that he may possess, he must always give up the same portion of
his rest his freedom, and his happiness." ("Wealth of Nations," b. I. ch.
V.) On the one hand Adam Smith here (but not everywhere) confuses the
determination of value by means of the quantity of labour expended in the
production of commodities, with the determination of the values of
commodities by means of the value of labour, and seeks in consequence to
prove that equal quantities of labour have always the same value. On the
other hand he has a presentiment, that labour, so far as it manifests
itself in the value of commodities, counts only as expenditure of
labour-power, but he treats this expenditure as the mere sacrifice of rest,
freedom, and happiness, not as at the same time the normal activity of
living beings. But then, he has the modern wage-labourer in his eye. Much
more aptly, the anonymous predecessor of Adam Smith, quoted above in Note
1, p. 39 [note 9 etext]. says "one man has employed himself a week in
providing this necessary of life ... and he that gives him some other in
exchange cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent, than
by computing what cost him just as much labour and time which in effect is
no more than exchanging one man's labour in one thing for a time certain,
for another man's labour in another thing for the same time." (l.c., p.
39.) [The English language has the advantage of possessing different words
for the two aspects of labour here considered. The labour which creates
Use-Value, and counts qualitatively, is Work, as distinguished from Labour,
that which creates Value and counts quantitatively, is Labour as
distinguished from Work - Engels]

[17] The few economists, amongst whom is S. Bailey, who have occupied
themselves with the analysis of the form of value, have been unable to
arrive at any result, first, because they confuse the form of value with
value itself; and second, because, under the coarse influence of the
practical bourgeois, they exclusively give their attention to the
quantitative aspect of the question. "The command of quantity ...
constitutes value." ("Money and its Vicissitudes." London, 1837, p. 11. By
S. Bailey.)

[18] The celebrated Franklin, one of the first economists, after Wm. Petty,
who saw through the nature of value, says: "Trade in general being nothing
else but the exchange of labour for labour, the value of all things is ...
most justly measured by labour." ("The works of B. Franklin, &c.," edited
by Sparks. Boston, 1836, Vol. II., p. 267.) Franklin is unconscious that by
estimating the value of everything in labour, he makes abstraction from any
difference in the sorts of labour exchanged, and thus reduces them all to
equal human labour. But although ignorant of this, yet he says it. He
speaks first of "the one labour," then of "the other labour," and finally
of "labour," without further qualification, as the substance of the value
of everything.

[19] In a sort of way, it is with man as with commodities. Since he comes
into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand, nor as a Fichtian
philosopher, to whom "I am I" is sufficient, man first sees and recognises
himself in other men. Peter only establishes his own identity as a man by
first comparing himself with Paul as being of like kind. And thereby Paul,
just as he stands in his Pauline personality, becomes to Peter the type of
the genus homo.

[20] Value is here, as occasionally in the preceding pages, used in sense
of value determined as to quantity, or of magnitude of value.

[21] This incongruity between the magnitude of value and its relative
expression has, with customary ingenuity, been exploited by vulgar
economists. For example -"Once admit that A falls, because B, with which it
is exchanged, rises, while no less labour is bestowed in the meantime on A,
and your general principle of value falls to the ground.... If he [Ricardo]
allowed that when A rises in value relatively to B, B falls in value
relatively to A, he cut away the ground on which he rested his grand
proposition, that the value of a commodity is ever determined by the labour
embodied in it, for if a change in the cost of A alters not only its own
value in relation to B, for which it is exchanged, but also the value of B
relatively to that of A, though no change has taken place in the quantity
of labour to produce B, then not only the doctrine falls to the ground
which asserts that the quantity of labour bestowed on an article regulates
its value, but also that which affirms the cost of an article to regulate
its value' (J. Broadhurst: "Political Economy," London, 1842, pp. 11 and
14.) Mr. Broadhurst might just as well say: consider the fractions 10/20,
10/50, 10/100, &c., the number 10 remains unchanged, and yet its
proportional magnitude, its magnitude relatively to the numbers 20, 50, 100
&c., continually diminishes. Therefore the great principle that the
magnitude of a whole number, such as 10, is "regulated" by the number of
times unity is contained in it, falls to the ground. [The author explains
in section 4 of this chapter, pp. 80- 81, note 2 (note 33 etext), what he
understands by "Vulgar Economy." - Engels]

[22] Such expressions of relations in general, called by Hegel
reflex-categories, form a very curious class. For instance, one man is king
only because other men stand in the relation of subjects to him. They, on
the contrary, imagine that they are subjects because he is king.

[24] In Homer, for instance, the value of an article is expressed in a
series of different things II. Vll. 472-475.

[25] For this reason, we can speak of the coat-value of the linen when its
value is expressed in coats, or of its corn-value when expressed in corn,
and so on. Every such expression tells us, that what appears in the
use-values, cost, corn, &c., is the value of the linen. "The value of any
commodity denoting its relation in exchange, we may speak of it as ...
corn-value, cloth-value, according to the commodity with which it is
compared; and hence there are a thousand different kinds of value, as many
kinds of value as there are commodities in existence, and all are equally
real and equally nominal." ("A Critical Dissertation on the Nature,
Measures and Causes of Value: chiefly in reference to the writings of Mr.
Ricardo and his followers." By the author of "Essays on the Formation, &c.,
of Opinions. ' London, 1825, p. 39.) S. Bailey, the author of this
anonymous work, a work which in its day created much stir in England,
fancied that, by thus pointing out the various relative expressions of one
and the same value, he had proved the impossibility of any determination of
the concept of value. However narrow his own views may have been, yet, that
he laid his finger on some serious defects in the Ricardian Theory, is
proved by the animosity with which he was attacked by Ricardo's followers.
See the Westminster Review for example.

[26] It is by no means self-evident that this character of direct and
universal exchangeability is, so to speak, a polar one, and as intimately
connected with its opposite pole, the absence of direct exchangeability, as
the positive pole of the magnet is with its negative counterpart. It may
therefore be imagined that all commodities can simultaneously have this
character impressed upon them, just as it can be imagined that all
Catholics can be popes together. It is, of course, highly desirable in the
eyes of the petit bourgeois, for whom the production of commodities is the
nec plus ultra of human freedom and individual independence, that the
inconveniences resulting from this character of commodities not being
directly exchangeable, should be removed. Proudhon's socialism is a working
out of this Philistine Utopia, a form of socialism which, as I have
elsewhere shown, does not possess even the merit of originality. Long
before his time, the task was attempted with much better success by Gray,
Bray, and others. But, for all that, wisdom of this kind flourishes even
now in certain circles under the name of "science." Never has any school
played more tricks with the word science, than that of Proudhon, for "wo
Begriffe fehlen, Da stellt zur rechten Zeit ein Wort sich ein."

[27] Among the ancient Germans the unit for rneasuring land was what could
be harvested in a day, and was called Tagwerk, Tagwanne (jurnale, or terra
jurnalis, or diornalis), Mannsmaad, &c. (See G. L. von Maurer, "Einleitung
zur Geschichte der Mark-, &c. Verfassung," Munchen, 1854, p. 129 sq.)

[28] When, therefore, Galiani says: Value is a relation between persons —
"La Ricchezza e una ragione tra due persone," — he ought to have added: a
relation between persons expressed as a relation between things. (Galiani:
Della Moneta, p. 221, V. III. of Custodi's collection of "Scrittori
Classici Italiani di Economia Politica." Parte Moderna, Milano 1803.)

[29] What are we to think of a law that asserts itself only by periodical
revolutions? It is just nothing but a law of Nature, founded on the want of
knowledge of those whose action is the subject of it." (Friedrich Engels:
"Umrisse zu einer Kritik der Nationalokonomie," in the
"Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher," edited by Arnold Ruge and Karl Marx.
Paris. 1844.)

[30] Even Ricardo has his stories a la Robinson. "He makes the primitive
hunter and the primitive fisher straightway, as owners of commodities,
exchange fish and game in the proportion in which labour-time is
incorporated in these exchange-values. On this occasion he commits the
anachronism of making these men apply to the calculation, so far as their
implements have to be taken into account, the annuity tables in current use
on the London Exchange in the year 1817. The parallelograms of Mr. Owen'
appear to be the only form of society, besides the bourgeois form, with
which he was acquainted." (Karl Marx: "Zur Kritik, &c.." pp. 38, 39)

[31] 'A ridiculous presumption has latterly got abroad that common property
in its primitive form is specifically a Slavonian, or even exclusively
Russian form. It is the primitive form that we can prove to have existed
amongst Romans, Teutons, and Celts, and even to this day we find numerous
examples, ruins though they be, in India. A more exhaustive study of
Asiatic, and especially of Indian forms of common property, would show how
from the different forms of primitive common property, different forms of
its dissolution have been developed. Thus, for instance, the various
original types of Roman and Teutonic private property are deducible from
different forms of Indian common property." (Karl Marx, "Zur Kritik, &c.,"
p. 10.)

[32] The insufficiency of Ricardo's analysis of the magnitude of value, and
his analysis is by far the best, will appear from the 3rd and 4th books of
this work. As regards value in general, it is the weak point of the
classical school of Political Economy that it nowhere expressly and with
full consciousness, distinguishes between labour, as it appears in the
value of a product, and the same labour, as it appears in the use-value of
that product. Of course the distinction is practically made, since this
school treats labour, at one time under its quantitative aspect, at another
under its qualitative aspect. But it has not the least idea, that when the
difference between various kinds of labour is treated as purely
quantitative, their qualitative unity or equality, and therefore their
reduction to abstract human labour, is implied. For instance, Ricardo
declares that he agrees with Destutt de Tracy in this proposition: "As it
is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original
riches, the employment of those faculties, labour of some kind, is our only
original treasure, and it is always from this employment that all those
things are created which we call riches.... It is certain, too, that all
those things only represent the labour which has created them, and if they
have a value, or even two distinct values, they can only derive them from
that (the value) of the labour from which they emanate." (Ricardo, "The
Principles of Pol. Econ.," 3 Ed. Lond. 1821, p. 334.) We would here only
point out, that Ricardo puts his own more profound interpretation upon the
words of Destutt. What the latter really says is, that on the one hand all
things which constitute wealth represent the labour that creates them, but
that on the other hand, they acquire their "two different values"
(use-value and exchange-value) from "the value of labour." He thus falls
into the commonplace error of the vulgar economists, who assume the value
of one commodity (in this case labour) in order to determine the values of
the rest. But Ricardo reads him as if he had said, that labour (not the
value of labour) is embodied both in use-value and exchange-value.
Nevertheless, Ricardo himself pays so little attention to the two-fold
character of the labour which has a two-fold embodiment, that he devotes
the whole of his chapter on "Value and Riches, Their Distinctive
Properties," to a laborious examination of the trivialities of a J.B. Say.
And at the finish he is quite astonished to find that Destutt on the one
hand agrees with him as to labour being the source of value, and on the
other hand with J. B. Say as to the notion of value.

[33] It is one of the chief failings of classical economy that it has never
succeeded, by means of its analysis of commodities, and, in particular, of
their value, in discovering that form under which value becomes
exchange-value. Even Adam Smith and Ricardo, the best representatives of
the school, treat the form of value as a thing of no importance, as having
no connexion with the inherent nature of commodities. The reason for this
is not solely because their attention is entirely absorbed in the analysis
of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The value-form of the product of
labour is not only the most abstract, but is also the most universal form,
taken by the product in bourgeois production and stamps that production as
a particular species of social production, and thereby gives it its special
historical character. If then we treat this mode of production as one
eternally fixed by Nature for every state of society, we necessarily
overlook that which is the differentia specifica of the value-form, and
consequently of the commodity-form, and of its further developments,
money-form, capital-form, &c. We consequently find that economists, who are
thoroughly agreed as to labour-time being the measure of the magnitude of
value, have the most strange and contradictory ideas of money, the
perfected form of the general equivalent. This is seen in a striking manner
when they treat of banking, where the commonplace definitions of money will
no longer hold water. This led to the rise of a restored mercantile system
(Ganilh, &c.), which sees in value nothing but a social form, or rather the
unsubstantial ghost of that form. Once for all I may here state, that by
classical Political Economy, I understand that economy which, since the
time of W. Petty, has investigated the real relations of production in
bourgeois society in contradistinction to vulgar economy, which deals with
appearances only, ruminates without ceasing on the materials long since
provided by scientific economy, and there seeks plausible explanations of
the most obtrusive phenomena, for bourgeois daily use, but for the rest,
confines itself to systematising in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for
everlasting truths, the trite ideas held by the self-complacent bourgeoisie
with regard to their own world, to them the best of all possible worlds.

[34] "Les economistes ont une singuliere maniere de proceder. Il n'y a pour
eux que deux sortes d'institutions, celles de l'art et celles de la nature.
Les institutions de la feodalite sont des institutions artificielles celles
de la bourgeoisie sont des institutions naturelles. Ils ressemblent en ceci
aux theologiens, qui eux aussi etablissent deux sortes de religions. Toute
religion qui n'est pas la leur, est une invention des hommes tandis que
leur propre religion est une emanation de Dieu -Ainsi il y a eu de
l'histoire, mais il n'y en a plus." (Karl Marx. Misere de la Philosophie.
Reponse a la Philosophie de la Misere par M. Proudhon, 1847, p. 113.) Truly
comical is M. Bastiat, who imagines that the ancient Greeks and Romans
lived by plunder alone. But when people plunder for centuries, there must
always be something at hand for them to seize; the objects of plunder must
be continually reproduced. It would thus appear that even Greeks and Romans
had some process of production, consequently, an economy, which just as
much constituted the material basis of their world, as bourgeois economy
constitutes that of our modern world. Or perhaps Bastiat means, that a mode
of production based on slavery is based on a system of plunder. In that
case he treads on dangerous ground. If a giant thinker like Aristotle erred
in his appreciation of slave labour, why should a dwarf economist like
Bastiat be right in his appreciation of wage-labour? I seize this
opportunity of shortly answering an objection taken by a German paper in
America, to my work, "Zur Kritik der Pol. Oekonomie, 1859." In the
estimation of that paper, my view that each special mode of production and
the social relations corresponding to it, in short, that the economic
structure of society, is the real basis on which the juridical and
political superstructure is raised and to which definite social forms of
thought correspond; that the mode of production determines the character of
the social, political, and intellectual life generally, all this is very
true for our own times, in which material interests preponderate, but not
for the middle ages, in which Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome, where
politics, reigned supreme. In the first place it strikes one as an odd
thing for any one to suppose that these well-worn phrases about the middle
ages and the ancient world are unknown to anyone else. This much, however,
is clear, that the middle ages could not live on Catholicism, nor the
ancient world on politics. On the contrary, it is the mode in which they
gained a livelihood that explains why here politics, and there Catholicism,
played the chief part. For the rest, it requires but a slight acquaintance
with the history of the Roman republic, for example, to be aware that its
secret history is the history of its landed property. On the other hand,
Don Quixote long ago paid the penalty for wrongly imagining that knight
errantry was compatible with all economic forms of society.

relating to value and to demand and supply" Lond., 1821, p. 16.

[37] The author of "Observations" and S. Bailey accuse Ricardo of
converting exchange-value from something relative into something absolute.
The opposite is the fact. He has explained the apparent relation between
objects, such as diamonds and pearls, in which relation they appear as
exchange-values, and disclosed the true relation hidden behind the
appearances, namely, their relation to each other as mere expressions of
human labour. If the followers of Ricardo answer Bailey somewhat rudely,
and by no means convincingly, the reason is to be sought in this, that they
were unable to find in Ricardo's own works any key to the hidden relations
existing between value and its form, exchange-value.

                                    CHAPTER TWO:
                                         EXCHANGE 




          

         It is plain that commodities cannot go to market and make exchanges of their own account. We must, therefore, have
      recourse to their guardians, who are also their owners Commodities are things, and therefore without power of resistance
      against man. If they are wanting in docility he can use force; in other words, he can take possession of them. [1] In order that
      these objects may enter into relation with each other as commodities, their guardians must place themselves in relation to one
      another, as persons whose will resides in those object, and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the
      commodity of the other, and part with his own, except by means of an act done by mutual consent. They must therefore,
      mutually recognise in each other the rights of private proprietors. This juridical relation, which thus expresses itself in a contract,
      whether such contract be part of a developed legal system or not, is a relation between two wills, and is but the reflex of the
      real economic relation between the two. It is this economic relation that determines the subject-matter comprised in each such
      juridical act. [2] 

         The persons exist for one another merely as representatives of, and, therefore. as owners of, commodities. In the course of
      our investigation we shall find, in general, that the characters who appear on the economic stage are but the personifications of
      the economic relations that exist between them. 

         What chiefly distinguishes a commodity from its owner is the fact, that it looks upon every other commodity as but the form
      of appearance of its own value. A born leveller and a cynic, it is always ready to exchange not only soul, but body, with any
      and every other commodity, be the same more repulsive than Maritornes herself. The owner makes up for this lack in the
      commodity of a sense of the concrete, by his own five and more senses. His commodity possesses for himself no immediate
      use-value. Otherwise, he would not bring it to the market. It has use-value for others; but for himself its only direct use-value is
      that of being a depository of exchange-value, and, consequently, a means of exchange.[3] Therefore, he makes up his mind to
      part with it for commodities whose value in use is of service to him. All commodities are non-use-values for their owners, and
      use-values for their non-owners. Consequently, they must all change hands. But this change of hands is what constitutes their
      exchange, and the latter puts them in relation with each other as values, and realises them as values. Hence commodities must
      be realised as values before they can be realised as use-values. 

         On the other hand, they must show that they are use-values before they can be realised as values. For the labour spent upon
      them counts effectively, only in so far as it is spent in a form that is useful for others. Whether that labour is useful for others,
      and its product consequently capable of satisfying the wants of others, can be proved only by the act of exchange. 

         Every owner of a commodity wishes to part with it in exchange only for those commodities whose use-value satisfies some
      want of his. Looked at in this way, exchange is for him simply a private transaction. On the other hand, he desires to realise the
      value of his commodity, to convert it into any other suitable commodity of equal value, irrespective of whether his own
      commodity has or has not any use-value for the owner of the other. From this point of view, exchange is for him a social
      transaction of a general character. But one and the same set of transactions cannot be simultaneously for all owners of
      commodities both exclusively private and exclusively social and general. 

         Let us look at the matter a little closer. To the owner of a commodity, every other commodity is, in regard to his own, a
      particular equivalent, and consequently his own commodity is the universal equivalent for all the others. But since this applies to
      every owner, there is, in fact, no commodity acting as universal equivalent, and the relative value of commodities possesses no
      general form under which they can be equated as values and have the magnitude of their values compared. So far, therefore,
      they do not confront each other as commodities, but only as products or use-values. In their difficulties our commodity owners
      think like Faust: "Im Anfang war die That." They therefore acted and transacted before they thought. Instinctively they conform
      to the laws imposed by the nature of commodities. They cannot bring their commodities into relation as values, and therefore as
      commodities, except by comparing them with some one other commodity as the universal equivalent. That we saw from the
      analysis of a commodity. But a particular commodity cannot become the universal equivalent except by a social act. The social
      action therefore of all other commodities, sets apart the particular commodity in which they all represent their values. Thereby
      the bodily form of this commodity becomes the form of the socially recognised universal equivalent. To be the universal
      equivalent, becomes, by this social process, the specific function of the commodity thus excluded by the rest. Thus it
      becomes—money. "Illi unum consilium habent et virtutem et potestatem suam bestiae tradunt. Et ne quis possit emere aut
      vendere, nisi qui habet characterem aut nomen bestiae aut numerum nominis ejus." (Apocalypse.) 

         Money is a crystal formed of necessity in the course of the exchanges, whereby different products of labour are practically
      equated to one another and thus by practice converted into commodities. The historical progress and extension of exchanges
      develops the contrast, latent in commodities, between use-value and value. The necessity for giving an external expression to
      this contrast for the purposes of commercial intercourse, urges on the establishment of an independent form of value, and finds
      no rest until it is once for all satisfied by the differentiation of commodities into commodities and money. At the same rate, then,
      as the conversion of products into commodities is being accomplished, so also is the conversion of one special commodity into
      money.[4] 

         The direct barter of products attains the elementary form of the relative expression of value in one respect, but not in
      another. That form is x Commodity A = y Commodity B. The form of direct barter is x use-value A = y use-value B.[5] The
      articles A and B in this case are not as yet commodities, but become so only by the act of barter. The first step made by an
      object of utility towards acquiring exchange-value is when it forms a non-use-value for its owner, and that happens when it
      forms a superfluous portion of some article required for his immediate wants. Objects in themselves are external to man, and
      consequently alienable by him. In order that this alienation may be reciprocal, it is only necessary for men, by a tacit
      understanding, to treat each other as private owners of those alienable objects, and by implication as independent individuals.
      But such a state of reciprocal independence has no existence in a primitive society based on property in common, whether such
      a society takes the form of a patriarchal family, an ancient Indian community, or a Peruvian Inca State. The exchange of
      commodities, therefore, first begins on the boundaries of such communities, at their points of contact with other similar
      communities, or with members of the latter. So soon, however, as products once become commodities in the external relations
      of a community, they also, by reaction, become so in its internal intercourse. The proportions in which they are exchangeable
      are at first quite a matter of chance. What makes them exchangeable is the mutual desire of their owners to alienate them.
      Meantime the need for foreign objects of utility gradually establishes itself. The constant repetition of exchange makes it a
      normal social act. In the course of time, therefore, some portion at least of the products of labour must be produced with a
      special view to exchange. From that moment the distinction becomes firmly established between the utility of an object for the
      purposes of consumption, and its utility for the purposes of exchange. Its use-value becomes distinguished from its
      exchange-value. On the other hand, the quantitative proportion in which the articles are exchangeable, becomes dependent on
      their production itself. Custom stamps them as values with definite magnitudes. 

         In the direct barter of products, each commodity is directly a means of exchange to its owner, and to all other persons an
      equivalent, but that only in so far as it has use-value for them. At this stage, therefore, the articles exchanged do not acquire a
      value-form independent of their own use-value, or of the individual needs of the exchangers. The necessity for a value-form
      grows with the increasing number and variety of the commodities exchanged. The problem and the means of solution arise
      simultaneously. Commodity-owners never equate their own commodities to those of others, and exchange them on a large
      scale, without different kinds of commodities belonging to different owners being exchangeable for, and equated as values to,
      one and the same special article. Such last-mentioned article, by becoming the equivalent of various other commodities,
      acquires at once, though within narrow limits, the character of a general social equivalent. This character comes and goes with
      the momentary social acts that called it into life. In turns and transiently it attaches itself first to this and then to that commodity.
      But with the development of exchange it fixes itself firmly and exclusively to particular sorts of commodities, and becomes
      crystallised by assuming the money-form. The particular kind of commodity to which it sticks is at first a matter of accident.
      Nevertheless there are two circumstances whose influence is decisive. The money-form attaches itself either to the most
      important articles of exchange from outside, and these in fact are primitive and natural forms in which the exchange-value of
      home products finds expression; or else it attaches itself to the object of utility that forms, like cattle, the chief portion of
      indigenous alienable wealth. Nomad races are the first to develop the money-form, because all their worldly goods consist of
      moveable objects and are therefore directly alienable; and because their mode of life, by continually bringing them into contact
      with foreign communities, solicits the exchange of products. Man has often made man himself, under the form of slaves, serve
      as the primitive material of money, but has never used land for that purpose. Such an idea could only spring up in a bourgeois
      society already well developed. It dates from the last third of the 17th century, and the first attempt to put it in practice on a
      national scale was made a century afterwards, during the French bourgeois revolution. 

         In proportion as exchange bursts its local bonds, and the value of commodities more and more expands into an embodiment
      of human labour in the abstract, in the same proportion the character of money attaches itself to commodities that are by Nature
      fitted to perform the social function of a universal equivalent. Those commodities are the precious metals. 

         The truth of the proposition that, "although gold and silver are not by Nature money, money is by Nature gold and silver,"[6]
      is shown by the fitness of the physical properties of these metals for the functions of money.[7] Up to this point, however, we
      are acquainted only with one function of money, namely, to serve as the form of manifestation of the value of commodities, or
      as the material in which the magnitudes of their values are socially expressed. An adequate form of manifestation of value, a fit
      embodiment of abstract, undifferentiated, and therefore equal human labour, that material alone can be whose every sample
      exhibits the same uniform qualities. On the other hand, since the difference between the magnitudes of value is purely
      quantitative, the money commodity must be susceptible of merely quantitative differences, must therefore be divisible at will,
      and equally capable of being reunited. Gold and silver possess these properties by Nature. 

         The use-value of the money-commodity becomes two-fold. In addition to its special use-value as a commodity (gold, for
      instance, serving to stop teeth, to form the raw material of articles of luxury, &c.), it acquires a formal use-value, originating in
      its specific social function. 

         Since all commodities are merely particular equivalents of money, the latter being their universal equivalent, they, with regard
      to the latter as the universal commodity, play the parts of particular commodities. [8] 

         We have seen that the money-form is but the reflex, thrown upon one single commodity, of the value relations between all
      the rest. That money is a commodity [9] is therefore a new discovery only for those who, when they analyse it, start from its
      fully developed shape. The act of exchange gives to the commodity converted into money, not its value, but its specific
      value-form. By confounding these two distinct things some writers have been led to hold that the value of gold and silver is
      imaginary. [10] The fact that money can, in certain functions, be replaced by mere symbols of itself, gave rise to that other
      mistaken notion, that it is itself a mere symbol. Nevertheless under this error lurked a presentiment that the money-form of an
      object is not an inseparable part of that object, but is simply the form under which certain social relations manifest themselves.
      In this sense every commodity is a symbol, since, in so far as it is value, it is only the material envelope of the human labour
      spent upon it.[11] But if it be declared that the social characters assumed by objects, or the material forms assumed by the
      social qualities of labour under the régime of a definite mode of production, are mere symbols, it is in the same breath also
      declared that these characteristics are arbitrary fictions sanctioned by the so-called universal consent of mankind. This suited
      the mode of explanation in favour during the 18th century. Unable to account for the origin of the puzzling forms assumed by
      social relations between man and man, people sought to denude them of their strange appearance by ascribing to them a
      conventional origin. 

         It has already been remarked above that the equivalent form of a commodity does not imply the determination of the
      magnitude of its value. Therefore, although we may be aware that gold is money, and consequently directly exchangeable for all
      other commodities, yet that fact by no means tells how much 10 lbs., for instance, of gold is worth. Money, like every other
      commodity, cannot express the magnitude of its value except relatively in other commodities. This value is determined by the
      labour-time required for its production, and is expressed by the quantity of any other commodity that costs the same amount of
      labour-time. [12] Such quantitative determination of its relative value takes place at the source of its production by means of
      barter. When it steps into circulation as money, its value is already given. In the last decades of the 17th century it had already
      been shown that money is a commodity, but this step marks only the infancy of the analysis. The difficulty lies, not in
      comprehending that money is a commodity, but in discovering how, why, and by what means a commodity becomes money.
      [13] 

         We have already seen, from the most elementary expression of value, x commodity A = y commodity B, that the object in
      which the magnitude of the value of another object is represented, appears to have the equivalent form independently of this
      relation, as a social property given to it by Nature. We followed up this false appearance to its final establishment, which is
      complete so soon as the universal equivalent form becomes identified with the bodily form of a particular commodity, and thus
      crystallised into the money-form. What appears to happen is, not that gold becomes money, in consequence of all other
      commodities expressing their values in it, but, on the contrary, that all other commodities universally express their values in gold,
      because it is money. The intermediate steps of the process vanish in the result and leave no trace behind. Commodities find their
      own value already completely represented, without any initiative on their part, in another commodity existing in company with
      them. These objects, gold and silver, just as they come out of the bowels of the earth, are forthwith the direct incarnation of all
      human labour. Hence the magic of money. In the form of society now under consideration, the behaviour of men in the social
      process of production is purely atomic. Hence their relations to each other in production assume a material character
      independent of their control and conscious individual action. These facts manifest themselves at first by products as a general
      rule taking the form of commodities. We have seen how the progressive development of a society of commodity-producers
      stamps one privileged commodity with the character of money. Hence the riddle presented by money is but the riddle presented
      by commodities; only it now strikes us in its most glaring form.

      [1] In the 12th century, so renowned for its piety, they included amongst commodities some very delicate things. Thus a French
      poet of the period enumerates amongst the goods to be found in the market of Landit, not only clothing shoes, leather,
      agricultural implements, &c., but also "femmes folles de leur corps." 

      [2] Proudhon begins by taking his ideal of Justice, of "justice éternelle," from the juridical relations that correspond to the
      production of commodities: thereby, it may be noted, he proves, to the consolation of all good citizens, that the production of
      commodities is a form of production as everlasting as justice. Then he turns round and seeks to reform the actual production of
      commodities, and the actual legal system corresponding thereto, in accordance with this ideal. What opinion should we have of
      a chemist, who, instead of studying the actual laws of the molecular changes in the composition and decomposition of matter,
      and on that foundation solving definite problems, claimed to regulate the composition and decomposition of matter by means of
      the "eternal ideas," of "naturalité" and "affinité"? Do we really know any more about "usury," when we say it contradicts "justice
      éternelle," équité éternelle "mutualité éternelle," and other vérités éternelle than the fathers of the church did when they said it
      was incompatible with '-grâce éternelle," "foi éternelle," and "la volonté éternelle de Dieu"? 

      [3] "For two-fold is the use of every object.... The one is peculiar to the object as such, the other is not, as a sandal which may
      be worn, and is also exchangeable. Both are uses of the sandal, for even he who exchanges the sandal for the money or food
      he is in want of, makes use of the sandal as a sandal. But not in its natural way. For it has not been made for the sake of being
      exchanged." (Aristoteles, "De Rep." l. i. c. 9.) 

      [4] From this we may form an estimate of the shrewdness of the petit-bourgeois socialism. which, while perpetuating the
      production of commodities, aims at abolishing the "antagonism" between money and commodities, and consequently, since
      money exists only by virtue of this antagonism, at abolishing money itself. We might just as well try to retain Catholicism without
      the Pope. For more on this point see my work, "Zur Kritik der Pol. Oekon.", p. 61, sq. 

      [5] So long as, instead of two distinct use-values being exchanged, a chaotic mass of articles are offered as the equivalent of a
      single article, which is often the case with savages, even the direct barter of products is in its first infancy.

      hand. "How could different nations give an imaginary value to any single thing... or how could this imaginary value have
      maintained itself?" But the following shows how little he himself understood about the matter: "Silver was exchanged in
      proportion to the value in use it possessed, consequently in proportion to its real value. By its adoption as money it received an
      additional value (une valeur additionnelle)". (Jean Law: "Considérations sur le numéraire et le commerce" in E. Daire's Edit. of

      valuable article as a mere symbol- the article counts not for what it is, but for what it is worth." (Hegel, l. c., p. 100.) Lawyers
      started long before economists the idea that money is a mere symbol, and that the value of the precious metals is purely
      imaginary. This they did in the sycophantic service of the crowned heads, supporting the right of the latter to debase the
      coinage, during the whole of the middle ages, by the traditions of the Roman Empire and the conceptions of money to be found
      in the Pandects. "Qu'aucun puisse ni doive faire doute," says an apt scholar of theirs Philip of Valois, in a decree of 1346, "que
      à nous et à notre majesté royale n'appartiennent seulement ... le mestier, le fait, l'état, la provision et toute l'ordonnance des
      monnaies, de donner tel cours, et pour tel prix comme il nous plait et bon nous semble." It was a maxim of the Roman Law that
      the value of money was fixed by decree of the emperor. It was expressly forbidden to treat money as a commodity. "Pecunias
      vero nulli emere fas erit, nam in usu publico constitutas oportet non esse mercem." Some good work on this question has been
      done by G. F. Pagnini: "Saggio sopra il giusto pregio delle cose, 1751"; Custodi "Parte Moderna," t. II. In the second part of
      his work Pagnini directs his polemics especially against the lawyers.

      [13] The learned Professor Roscher, after first informing us that "the false definitions of money may be divided into two main
      groups: those which make it more, and those which make it less, than a commodity," gives us a long and very mixed catalogue
      of works on the nature of money, from which it appears that he has not the remotest idea of the real history of the theory; and
      then he moralises thus: "For the rest, it is not to be denied that most of the later economists do not bear sufficiently in mind the
      peculiarities-that distinguish money from other commodities" (it is then, after all, either more or less than a commodity!)... 'So
      far, the semi-mercantilist reaction of Ganilh is not altogether without foundation." (Wilhelm Roscher: "Die Grundlagen der
      Nationaloekonomie," 3rd Edn. 1858, pp. 207-210.) More! less! not sufficiently! so far! not altogether! What clearness and
      precision of ideas and language! And such eclectic professorial twaddle is modestly baptised by Mr. Roscher, "the
      anatomico-physiological method" of Political Economy! One discovery however, he must have credit for, namely, that money is
      "a pleasant commodity." 




          

         Throughout this work, I assume, for the sake of simplicity, gold as the money-commodity. 

         The first chief function of money is to supply commodities with the material for the expression of their values, or to represent
      their values as magnitudes of the same denomination, qualitatively equal, and quantitatively comparable. It thus serves as a
      universal measure of value. And only by virtue of this function does gold, the equivalent commodity par excellence, become
      money. 

         It is not money that renders commodities commensurable. Just the contrary. It is because all commodities, as values, are
      realised human labour, and therefore commensurable, that their values can be measured by one and the same special
      commodity, and the latter be converted into the common measure of their values, i.e., into money. Money as a measure of
      value, is the phenomenal form that must of necessity be assumed by that measure of value which is immanent in commodities,
      labour-time. [1] 

         The expression of the value of a commodity in gold — x commodity A = y money-commodity — is its money-form or
      price. A single equation, such as 1 ton of iron = 2 ounces of gold, now suffices to express the value of the iron in a socially valid
      manner. There is no longer any need for this equation to figure as a link in the chain of equations that express the values of all
      other commodities, because the equivalent commodity, gold, now has the character of money. The general form of relative
      value has resumed its original shape of simple or isolated relative value. On the other hand, the expanded expression of relative
      value, the endless series of equations, has now become the form peculiar to the relative value of the money-commodity. The
      series itself, too, is now given, and has social recognition in the prices of actual commodities. We have only to read the
      quotations of a price-list backwards, to find the magnitude of the value of money expressed in all sorts of commodities. But
      money itself has no price. In order to put it on an equal footing with all other commodities in this respect, we should be obliged
      to equate it to itself as its own equivalent. 

         The price or money-form of commodities is, like their form of value generally, a form quite distinct from their palpable bodily
      form; it is, therefore, a purely ideal or mental form. Although invisible, the value of iron, linen and corn has actual existence in
      these very articles: it is ideally made perceptible by their equality with gold, a relation that, so to say, exists only in their own
      heads. Their owner must, therefore, lend them his tongue, or hang a ticket on them, before their prices can be communicated to
      the outside world. [2] Since the expression of the value of commodities in gold is a merely ideal act, we may use for this
      purpose imaginary or ideal money. Every trader knows, that he is far from having turned his goods into money, when he has
      expressed their value in a price or in imaginary money, and that it does not require the least bit of real gold, to estimate in that
      metal millions of pounds' worth of goods. When, therefore, money serves as a measure of value; it is employed only as
      imaginary or ideal money. This circumstance has given rise to the wildest theories. [3] But, although the money that performs
      the functions of a measure of value is only ideal money, price depends entirely upon the actual substance that is money. The
      value, or in other words, the quantity of human labour contained in a ton of iron, is expressed in imagination by such a quantity
      of the money-commodity as contains the same amount of labour as the iron. According, therefore, as the measure of value is
      gold, silver, or copper, the value of the ton of iron will be expressed by very different prices, or will be represented by very
      different quantities of those metals respectively. 

         If, therefore, two different commodities, such as gold and silver, are simultaneously measures of value, all commodities have
      two prices — one a gold-price, the other a silver-price. These exist quietly side by side, so long as the ratio of The value of
      silver to that of gold remains unchanged, say, at 15:1. Every change in their ratio disturbs the ratio which exists between the
      gold-prices and the silver-prices of commodities, and thus proves, by facts, that a double standard of value is inconsistent with
      the functions of a standard. [4] 

         Commodities with definite prices present themselves under the form; a commodity A = x gold; b commodity B = z gold; c
      commodity C = y gold, &c., where a, b, c, represent definite quantities of the commodities A, B, C and x, z, y, definite
      quantities of gold. The values of these commodities are, therefore, changed in imagination into so many different quantities of
      gold. Hence, in spite of the confusing variety of the commodities themselves, their values become magnitudes of the same
      denomination, gold-magnitudes. They are now capable of being compared with each other and measured, and the want
      becomes technically felt of comparing them with some fixed quantity of gold as a unit measure. This unit, by subsequent division
      into aliquot parts, becomes itself the standard or scale. Before they become money, gold, silver, and copper already possess
      such standard measures in their standards of weight, so that, for example, a pound weight, while serving as the unit, is, on the
      one hand, divisible into ounces, and, on the other, may be combined to make up hundredweights. [5] It is owing to this that, in
      all metallic currencies, the names given to the standards of money or of price were originally taken from the pre-existing names
      of the standards of weight. 

         As measure of Value, and as standard of price, money has two entirely distinct functions to perform. It is the measure of
      value inasmuch as it is the socially recognised incarnation of human labour; it is the standard of price inasmuch as it is a fixed
      weight of metal. As the measure of value it serves to convert the values of all the manifold commodities into prices, into
      imaginary quantities of gold; as the standard of price it measures those quantities of gold. The measure of values measures
      commodities considered as values; the standard of price measures, on the contrary, quantities of gold by a unit quantity of gold,
      not the value of one quantity of gold by the weight of another. In order to make gold a standard of price, a certain weight must
      be fixed upon as the unit. In this case, as in all cases of measuring quantities of the same denomination, the establishment of an
      unvarying unit of measure is all-important. Hence, the less the unit is subject to variation, so much the better does the standard
      of price fulfil its office. But only in so far as it is itself a product of labour, and, therefore, potentially variable in value, can gold
      serve as a measure of value. [6] 

         It is, in the first place, quite clear that a change in the value of gold does not, in any way, affect its function as a standard of
      price. No matter how this value varies, the proportions between the values of different quantities of the metal remain constant.
      However great the fall in its value, 12 ounces of gold still have 12 times the value of 1 ounce; and in prices, the only thing
      considered is the relation between different quantities of gold. Since, on the other hand, no rise or fall in the value of an ounce of
      gold can alter its weight, no alteration can take place in the weight of its aliquot parts. Thus gold always renders the same
      service as an invariable standard of price, however much its value may vary. 

         In the second place, a change in the value of gold does not interfere with its functions as a measure of value. The change
      affects all commodities simultaneously, and, therefore, caeteris paribus, leaves their relative values inter se, unaltered, although
      those values are now expressed in higher or lower gold-prices. 

         Just as when we estimate the value of any commodity by a definite quantity of the use-value of some other commodity, so in
      estimating the value of the former in gold, we assume nothing more than that the production of a given quantity of gold costs, at
      the given period, a given amount of labour. As regards the fluctuations of prices generally, they are subject to the laws of
      elementary relative value investigated in a former chapter. 

         A general rise in the prices of commodities can result only, either from a rise in their values — the value of money remaining
      constant — or from a fall in the value of money, the values of commodities remaining constant. On the other hand, a general fall
      in prices can result only, either from a fall in the values of commodities — the value of money remaining constant — or from a
      rise in the value of money, the values of commodities remaining constant. It therefore by no means follows, that a rise in the
      value of money necessarily implies a proportional fall in the prices of commodities; or that a fall in the value of money implies a
      proportional rise in prices. Such change of price holds good only in the case of commodities whose value remains constant.
      With those, for example, whose value rises, simultaneously with, and proportionally to, that of money, there is no alteration in
      price. And if their value rise either slower or faster than that of money, the fall or rise in their prices will be determined by the
      difference between the change in their value and that of money; and so on. 

         Let us now go back to the consideration of the price-form. 

         By degrees there arises a discrepancy between the current moneynames of the various weights of the precious metal figuring
      as money, and the actual weights which those names originally represented. This discrepancy is the result of historical causes,
      among which the chief are: — (1) The importation of foreign money into an imperfectly developed community. This happened
      in Rome in its early days, where gold and silver coins circulated at first as foreign commodities. The names of these foreign
      coins never coincide with those of the indigenous weights. (2) As wealth increases, the less precious metal is thrust out by the
      more precious from its place as a measure of value, copper by silver, silver by gold, however much this order of sequence may
      be in contradiction with poetical chronology. [7] The word pound, for instance, was the money-name given to an actual pound
      weight of silver. When gold replaced silver as a measure of value, the same name was applied according to the ratio between
      the values of silver and gold, to perhaps 1-15th of a pound of gold. The word pound, as a money-name, thus becomes
      differentiated from the same word as a weight-name. [8] (3) The debasing of money carried on for centuries by kings and
      princes to such an extent that, of the original weights of the coins, nothing in fact remained but the names. [9] 

         These historical causes convert the separation of the money-name from the weight-name into an established habit with the
      community. Since the standard of money is on the one hand purely conventional, and must on the other hand find general
      acceptance, it is in the end regulated by law. A given weight of one of the precious metals, an ounce of gold, for instance,
      becomes officially divided into aliquot parts, with legally bestowed names, such as pound, dollar, &c. These aliquot parts,
      which thenceforth serve as units of money, are then subdivided into other aliquot parts with legal names, such as shilling, penny,
      &c. [10] But, both before and after these divisions are made, a definite weight of metal is the standard of metallic money. The
      sole alteration consists in the subdivision and denomination. 

         The prices, or quantities of gold, into which the values of commodities are ideally changed, are therefore now expressed in
      the names of coins, or in the legally valid names of the subdivisions of the gold standard. Hence, instead of saying: A quarter of
      wheat is worth an ounce of gold; we say, it is worth £3 17s. 10 1/2d. In this way commodities express by their prices how
      much they are worth, and money serves as money of account whenever it is a question of fixing the value of an article in its
      money-form. [11] 

         The name of a thing is something distinct from the qualities of that thing. I know nothing of a man, by knowing that his name
      is Jacob. In the same way with regard to money, every trace of a value-relation disappears in the names pound, dollar, franc,
      ducat, &c. The confusion caused by attributing a hidden meaning to these cabalistic signs is all the greater, because these
      money-names express both the values of commodities, and, at the same time, aliquot parts of the weight of the metal that is the
      standard of money. [12] On the other hand, it is absolutely necessary that value, in order that it may be distinguished from the
      varied bodily forms of commodities, should assume this material and unmeaning, but, at the same time, purely social form. [13] 

         Price is the money-name of the labour realised in a commodity. Hence the expression of the equivalence of a commodity
      with the sum of money constituting its price, is a tautology, [14] just as in general the expression of the relative value of a
      commodity is a statement of the equivalence of two commodities. But although price, being the exponent of the magnitude of a
      commodity's value, is the exponent of its exchange-ratio with money, it does not follow that the exponent of this exchange-ratio
      is necessarily the exponent of the magnitude of the commodity's value. Suppose two equal quantities of socially necessary
      labour to be respectively represented by 1 quarter of wheat and £2 (nearly 1/2 oz. of gold), £2 is the expression in money of
      the magnitude of the value of the quarter of wheat, or is its price. If now circumstances allow of this price being raised to £3, or
      compel it to be reduced to £1, then although £1 and £3 may be too small or too great properly to express the magnitude of the
      wheat's value; nevertheless they are its prices, for they are, in the first place, the form under which its value appears, i.e.,
      money; and in the second place, the exponents of its exchange-ratio with money. If the conditions of production, in other
      words, if the productive power of labour remain constant, the same amount of social labour-time must, both before and after
      the change in price, be expended in the reproduction of a quarter of wheat. This circumstance depends, neither on the will of
      the wheat producer, nor on that of the owners of other commodities. 

         Magnitude of value expresses a relation of social production, it expresses the connexion that necessarily exists between a
      certain article and the portion of the total labour-time of society required to produce it. As soon as magnitude of value is
      converted into price, the above necessary relation takes the shape of a more or less accidental exchange-ratio between a single
      commodity and another, the money-commodity. But this exchange-ratio may express either the real magnitude of that
      commodity's value, or the quantity of gold deviating from that value, for which, according to circumstances, it may be parted
      with. The possibility, therefore, of quantitative incongruity between price and magnitude of value, or the deviation of the former
      from the latter, is inherent in the price-form itself. This is no defect, but, on the contrary, admirably adapts the price-form to a
      mode of production whose inherent laws impose themselves only as the mean of apparently lawless irregularities that
      compensate one another. 

         The price-form, however, is not only compatible with the possibility of a quantitative incongruity between magnitude of value
      and price, i.e., between the former and its expression in money, but it may also conceal a qualitative inconsistency, so much so,
      that, although money is nothing but the value-form of commodities, price ceases altogether to express value. Objects that in
      themselves are no commodities, such as conscience, honour, &c., are capable of being offered for sale by their holders, and of
      thus acquiring, through their price, the form of commodities. Hence an object may have a price without having value. The price
      in that case is imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics. On the other hand, the imaginary price-form may sometimes
      conceal either a direct or indirect real value-relation; for instance, the price of uncultivated land, which is without value, because
      no human labour has been incorporated in it. 

         Price, like relative value in general, expresses the value of a commodity (e.g., a ton of iron), by stating that a given quantity
      of the equivalent (e.g., an ounce of gold), is directly exchangeable for iron. But it by no means states the converse, that iron is
      directly exchangeable for gold. In order, therefore, that a commodity may in practice act effectively as exchange-value, it must
      quit its bodily shape, must transform itself from mere imaginary into real gold, although to the commodity such transubstantiation
      may be more difficult than to the Hegelian "concept," the transition from "necessity" to "freedom," or to a lobster the casting of
      his shell, or to Saint Jerome the putting off of the old Adam. [15] Though a commodity may, side by side with its actual form
      (iron, for instance), take in our imagination the form of gold, yet it cannot at one and the same time actually be both iron and
      gold. To fix its price, it suffices to equate it to gold in imagination. But to enable it to render to its owner the service of a
      universal equivalent, it must be actually replaced by gold. If the owner of the iron were to go to the owner of some other
      commodity offered for exchange, and were to refer him to the price of the iron as proof that it was already money, he would
      get the same answer as St. Peter gave in heaven to Dante, when the latter recited the creed — 

               "Assad bene e trascorsa 
            D'esta moneta gia la lega e'l peso, 
            Ma dimmi se tu l'hai nella tua borsa." 

         A price therefore implies both that a commodity is exchangeable for money, and also that it must be so exchanged. On the
      other hand, gold serves as an ideal measure of value, only because it has already, in the process of exchange, established itself
      as the money-commodity. Under the ideal measure of values there lurks the hard cash.

                                       THE MEDIUM OF CIRCULATION




          

                                    A. The Metamorphosis of Commodities

         We saw in a former chapter that the exchange of commodities implies contradictory and mutually exclusive conditions. The
      differentiation of commodities into commodities and money does not sweep away these inconsistencies, but develops a modus
      vivendi, a form in which they can exist side by side. This is generally the way in which real contradictions are reconciled. For
      instance, it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another, and as, at the same time, constantly flying
      away from it. The ellipse is a form of motion which, while allowing this contradiction to go on, at the same time reconciles it. 

         In so far as exchange is a process, by which commodities are transferred from hands in which they are non-use-values, to
      hands in which they become use-values, it is a social circulation of matter. The product of one form of useful labour replaces
      that of another. When once a commodity has found a resting-place, where it can serve as a use-value, it falls out of the sphere
      of exchange into that of consumption. But the former sphere alone interests us at present. We have, therefore, now to consider
      exchange from a formal point of view; to investigate the change of form or metamorphosis of commodities which effectuates the
      social circulation of matter. 

         The comprehension of this change of form is, as a rule, very imperfect. The cause of this imperfection is, apart from indistinct
      notions of value itself, that every change of form in a commodity results from the exchange of two commodities, an ordinary one
      and the money-commodity. If we keep in view the material fact alone that a commodity has been exchanged for gold, we
      overlook the very thing that we ought to observe — namely, what has happened to the form of the commodity. We overlook
      the facts that gold, when a mere commodity, is not money, and that when other commodities express their prices in gold, this
      gold is but the money-form of those commodities themselves. 

         Commodities, first of all, enter into the process of exchange just as they are. The process then differentiates them into
      commodities and money, and thus produces an external opposition corresponding to the internal opposition inherent in them, as
      being at once use-values and values. Commodities as use-values now stand opposed to money as exchange-value. On the
      other hand, both opposing sides are commodities, unities of use-value and value. But this unity of differences manifests itself at
      two opposite poles, and at each pole in an opposite way. Being poles they are as necessarily opposite as they are connected.
      On the one side of the equation we have an ordinary commodity, which is in reality a use-value. Its value is expressed only
      ideally in its price, by which it is equated to its opponent, the gold, as to the real embodiment of its value. On the other hand,
      the gold, in its metallic reality, ranks as the embodiment of value, as money. Gold, as gold, is exchange-value itself. As to its
      use-value, that has only an ideal existence, represented by the series of expressions of relative value in which it stands face to
      face with all other commodities, the sum of whose uses makes up the sum of the various uses of gold. These antagonistic forms
      of commodities are the real forms in which the process of their exchange moves and takes place. 

         Let us now accompany the owner of some commodity — say, our old friend the weaver of linen — to the scene of action,
      the market. His 20 yards of linen has a definite price, £2. He exchanges it for the £2, and then, like a man of the good old
      stamp that he is, he parts with the £2 for a family Bible of the same price. The linen, which in his eyes is a mere commodity, a
      depository of value, he alienates in exchange for gold, which is the linen's value-form, and this form he again parts with for
      another commodity, the Bible, which is destined to enter his house as an object of utility and of edification to its inmates. The
      exchange becomes an accomplished fact by two metamorphoses of opposite yet supplementary character — the conversion of
      the commodity into money, and the re-conversion of the money into a commodity. [16] The two phases of this metamorphosis
      are both of them distinct transactions of the weaver — selling, or the exchange of the commodity for money; buying, or the
      exchange of the money for a commodity; and, the unity of the two acts, selling in order to buy. 

         The result of the whole transaction, as regards the weaver, is this, that instead of being in possession of the linen, he now has
      the Bible; instead of his original commodity, he now possesses another of the same value but of different utility. In like manner
      he procures his other means of subsistence and means of production. From his point of view, the whole process effectuates
      nothing more than the exchange of the product of his labour for the product of some one else's, nothing more than an exchange
      of products. 

         The exchange of commodities is therefore accompanied by the following changes in their form. 

                                     Commodity — Money — Commodity.
                                           C—————— M ——————C. 

         The result of the whole process is, so far as concerns the objects themselves, C — C, the exchange of one commodity for
      another, the circulation of materialised social labour. When this result is attained, the process is at an end. 

           
                                       C — M. First metamorphosis, or sale

         The leap taken by value from the body of the commodity, into the body of the gold, is, as I have elsewhere called it, the
      salto mortale of the commodity. If it falls short, then, although the commodity itself is not harmed, its owner decidedly is. The
      social division of labour causes his labour to be as one-sided as his wants are many-sided. This is precisely the reason why the
      product of his labour serves him solely as exchange-value. But it cannot acquire the properties of a socially recognised universal
      equivalent, except by being converted into money. That money, however, is in some one else's pocket. In order to entice the
      money out of that pocket, our friend's commodity must, above all things, be a use-value to the owner of the money. For this, it
      is necessary that the labour expended upon it, be of a kind that is socially useful, of a kind that constitutes a branch of the social
      division of labour. But division of labour is a system of production which has grown up spontaneously and continues to grow
      behind the backs of the producers. The commodity to be exchanged may possibly be the product of some new kind of labour,
      that pretends to satisfy newly arisen requirements, or even to give rise itself to new requirements. A particular operation, though
      yesterday, perhaps, forming one out of the many operations conducted by one producer in creating a given commodity, may
      to-day separate itself from this connexion, may establish itself as an independent branch of labour and send its incomplete
      product to market as an independent commodity. The circumstances may or may not be ripe for such a separation. To-day the
      product satisfies a social want. Tomorrow the article may, either altogether or partially, be superseded by some other
      appropriate product. Moreover, although our weaver's labour may be a recognised branch of the social division of labour, yet
      that fact is by no means sufficient to guarantee the utility of his 20 yards of linen. If the community's want of linen, and such a
      want has a limit like every other want, should already be saturated by the products of rival weavers. our friend's product is
      superfluous, redundant, and consequently useless. Although people do not look a gift-horse in the mouth, our friend does not
      frequent the market for the purpose of making presents. But suppose his product turn out a real use-value, and thereby attracts
      money? The question arises, how much will it attract? No doubt the answer is already anticipated in the price of the article, in
      the exponent of the magnitude of its value. We leave out of consideration here any accidental miscalculation of value by our
      friend, a mistake that is soon rectified in the market. We suppose him to have spent on his product only that amount of
      labour-time that is on an average socially necessary. The price then, is merely the moneyname of the quantity of social labour
      realised in his commodity. But without the leave, and behind the back, of our weaver, the old-fashioned mode of weaving
      undergoes a change. The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen,
      ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend's
      competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market
      contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had
      superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a
      yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The
      effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially
      necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as
      one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard
      is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour. [17] 

         We see then, commodities are in love with money, but "the course of true love never did run smooth." The quantitative
      division of labour is brought about in exactly the same spontaneous and accidental manner as its qualitative division. The owners
      of commodities therefore find out, that the same division of labour that turns them into independent private producers, also frees
      the social process of production and the relations of the individual producers to each other within that process, from all
      dependence on the will of those producers, and that the seeming mutual independence of the individuals is supplemented by a
      system of general and mutual dependence through or by means of the products. 

         The division of labour converts the product of labour into a commodity, and thereby makes necessary its further conversion
      into money. At the same time it also makes the accomplishment of this transubstantiation quite accidental. Here, however, we
      are only concerned with the phenomenon in its integrity, and we therefore assume its progress to be normal. Moreover, if the
      conversion take place at all, that is, if the commodity be not absolutely unsaleable, its metamorphosis does take place although
      the price realised may be abnormally above or below the value. 

         The seller has his commodity replaced by gold, the buyer has his gold replaced by a commodity. The fact which here stares
      us in the face is, that a commodity and gold, 20 yards of linen and £2, have changed hands and places, in other words, that they
      have been exchanged. But for what is the commodity exchanged? For the shape assumed by its own value, for the universal
      equivalent. And for what is the gold exchanged? For a particular form of its own use-value. Why does gold take the form of
      money face to face with the linen? Because the linen's price of £2, its denomination in money, has already equated the linen to
      gold in its character of money. A commodity strips off its original commodity-form on being alienated, i.e., on the instant its
      use-value actually attracts the gold, that before existed only ideally in its price. The realisation of a commodity's price, or of its
      ideal value-form, is therefore at the same time the realisation of the ideal use-value of money; the conversion of a commodity
      into money, is the simultaneous conversion of money into a commodity. The apparently single process is in reality a double one.
      From the pole of the commodity-owner it is a sale, from the opposite pole of the money-owner, it is a purchase. In other
      words, a sale is a purchase, C—-M is also M—-C. [18] 

         Up to this point we have considered men in only one economic capacity, that of owners of commodities, a capacity in which
      they appropriate the produce of the labour of others, by alienating that of their own labour. Hence, for one commodity-owner
      to meet with another who has money, it is necessary, either, that the product of the labour of the latter person, the buyer, should
      be in itself money, should be gold, the material of which money consists, or that his product should already have changed its
      skin and have stripped off its original form of a useful object. In order that it may play the part of money, gold must of course
      enter the market at some point or other. This point is to be found at the source of production of the metal, at which place gold
      is bartered, as the immediate product of labour, for some other product of equal value. From that moment it always represents
      the realised price of some commodity. [19] Apart from its exchange for other commodities at the source of its production, gold,
      in whose-so-ever hands it may be, is the transformed shape of some commodity alienated by its owner; it is the product of a
      sale or of the first metamorphosis C—-M. [20] Gold, as we saw, became ideal money, or a measure of values, in consequence
      of all commodities measuring their values by it, and thus contrasting it ideally with their natural shape as useful objects, and
      making it the shape of their value. It became real money, by the general alienation of commodities, by actually changing places
      with their natural forms as useful objects, and thus becoming in reality the embodiment of their values. When they assume this
      money-shape, commodities strip off every trace of their natural use-value, and of the particular kind of labour to which they
      owe their creation, in order to transform themselves into the uniform, socially recognised incarnation of homogeneous human
      labour. We cannot tell from the mere look of a piece of money, for what particular commodity it has been exchanged. Under
      their money-form all commodities look alike. Hence, money may be dirt, although dirt is not money. We will assume that the
      two gold pieces, in consideration of which our weaver has parted with his linen, are the metamorphosed shape of a quarter of
      wheat. The sale of the linen, C—-M, is at the same time its purchase, M—-C. But the sale is the first act of a process that ends
      with a transaction of an opposite nature, namely, the purchase of a Bible; the purchase of the linen, on the other hand, ends a
      movement that began with a transaction of an opposite nature, namely, with the sale of the wheat. C—-M (linen—-money),
      which is the first phase of C—-M'—-C (linen—-money—-Bible), is also M—-C (money—-linen), the last phase of another
      movement C—-M—-C (wheat—-money—-linen). The first metamorphosis of one commodity, its transformation from a
      commodity into money, is therefore also invariably the second metamorphosis of some other commodity, the retransformation
      of the latter from money into a commodity. [21] 

                                           M—-C, or purchase. 
                       The second and concluding metamorphosis of a commodity 

         Because money is the metamorphosed shape of all other commodities, the result of their general alienation, for this reason it
      is alienable itself without restriction or condition. It reads all prices backwards, and thus, so to say, depicts itself in the bodies of
      all other commodities, which offer to it the material for the realisation of its own use-value. At the same time the prices, wooing
      glances cast at money by commodities, define the limits of its convertibility, by pointing to its quantity. Since every commodity,
      on becoming money, disappears as a commodity, it is impossible to tell from the money itself, how it got into the hands of its
      possessor, or what article has been changed into it. Non olet, from whatever source it may come. Representing on the one
      hand a sold commodity, it represents on the other a commodity to be bought. [22] 

         M—-C, a purchase, is, at the same time, C—-M, a sale; the concluding metamorphosis of one commodity is the first
      metamorphosis of another. With regard to our weaver, the life of his commodity ends with the Bible, into which he has
      reconverted his £2. But suppose the seller of the Bible turns the £2 set free by the weaver into brandy M—-C, the concluding
      phase of C—-M—-C (linen—-money—-Bible), is also C—-M, the first phase of C—-M—-C (Bible—-money—-brandy).
      The producer of a particular commodity has that one article alone to offer; this he sells very often in large quantities, but his
      many and various wants compel him to split up the price realised, the sum of money set free, into numerous purchases. Hence a
      sale leads to many purchases of various articles. The concluding metamorphosis of a commodity thus constitutes an aggregation
      of first metamorphoses of various other commodities. 

         If we now consider the completed metamorphosis of a commodity, as a whole, it appears in the first place, that it is made up
      of two opposite and complementary movements, C—-M and M—-C. These two antithetical transmutations of a commodity
      are brought about by two antithetical social acts on the part of the owner, and these acts in their turn stamp the character of the
      economic parts played by him. As the person who makes a sale, he is a seller; as the person who makes a purchase, he is a
      buyer. But just as, upon every such transmutation of a commodity, its two forms, commodity-form and money-form, exist
      simultaneously but at opposite poles, so every seller has a buyer opposed to him, and every buyer a seller. While one particular
      commodity is going through its two transmutations in succession, from a commodity into money and from money into another
      commodity, the owner of the commodity changes in succession his part from that of seller to that of buyer. These characters of
      seller and buyer are therefore not permanent, but attach themselves in turns to the various persons engaged in the circulation of
      commodities. 

         The complete metamorphosis of a commodity, in its simplest form, implies four extremes, and three dramatic personae.
      First, a commodity comes face to face with money; the latter is the form taken by the value of the former, and exists in all its
      hard reality, in the pocket of the buyer. A commodity-owner is thus brought into contact with a possessor of money. So soon,
      now, as the commodity has been changed into money, the money becomes its transient equivalent-form, the use-value of which
      equivalent-form is to be found in the bodies of other commodities. Money, the final term of the first transmutation, is at the same
      time the starting-point for the second. The person who is a seller in the first transaction thus becomes a buyer in the second, in
      which a third commodity-owner appears on the scene as a seller. [23] 

         The two phases, each inverse to the other, that make up the metamorphosis of a commodity constitute together a circular
      movement, a circuit: commodity-form, stripping off of this form, and return to the commodity-form. No doubt, the commodity
      appears here under two different aspects. At the starting-point it is not a use-value to its owner; at the finishing point it is. So,
      too, the money appears in the first phase as a solid crystal of value, a crystal into which the commodity eagerly solidifies, and in
      the second, dissolves into the mere transient equivalent-form destined to be replaced by a use-value. 

         The two metamorphoses constituting the circuit are at the same time two inverse partial metamorphoses of two other
      commodities. One and the same commodity, the linen, opens the series of its own metamorphoses, and completes the
      metamorphosis of another (the wheat). In the first phase or sale, the linen plays these two parts in its own person. But, then,
      changed into gold, it completes its own second and final metamorphosis, and helps at the same time to accomplish the first
      metamorphosis of a third commodity. Hence the circuit made by one commodity in the course of its metamorphoses is
      inextricably mixed up with the circuits of other commodities. The total of all the different circuits constitutes the circulation of
      commodities. 

         The circulation of commodities differs from the direct exchange of products (barter), not only in form, but in substance. Only
      consider the course of events. The weaver has, as a matter of fact, exchanged his linen for a Bible, his own commodity for that
      of some one else. But this is true only so far as he himself is concerned. The seller of the Bible, who prefers something to warm
      his inside, no more thought of exchanging his Bible for linen than our weaver knew that wheat had been exchanged for his linen.
      B's commodity replaces that of A, but A and B do not mutually exchange those commodities. It may, of course, happen that A
      and B make simultaneous purchases, the one from the other; but such exceptional transactions are by no means the necessary
      result of the general conditions of the circulation of commodities. We see here, on the one hand, how the exchange of
      commodities breaks through all local and personal bounds inseparable from direct barter, and develops the circulation of the
      products of social labour; and on the other hand, how it develops a whole network of social relations spontaneous in their
      growth and entirely beyond the control of the actors. It is only because the farmer has sold his wheat that the weaver is enabled
      to sell his linen, only because the weaver has sold his linen that our Hotspur is enabled to sell his Bible, and only because the
      latter has sold the water of everlasting life that the distiller is enabled to sell his eau-de-vie, and so on. 

         The process of circulation, therefore, does not, like direct barter of products, become extinguished upon the use-values
      changing places and hands. The money does not vanish on dropping out of the circuit of the metamorphosis of a given
      commodity. It is constantly being precipitated into new places in the arena of circulation vacated by other commodities. In the
      complete metamorphosis of the linen, for example, linen — money — Bible, the linen first falls out of circulation, and money
      steps into its place. Then the Bible falls out of circulation, and again money takes its place. When one commodity replaces
      another, the money-commodity always sticks to the hands of some third person. [24] Circulation sweats money from every
      pore. 

         Nothing can be more childish than the dogma, that because every sale is a purchase, and every purchase a sale, therefore
      the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium of sales and purchases. If this means that the number of actual
      sales is equal to the number of purchases, it is mere tautology. But its real purport is to prove that every seller brings his buyer
      to market with him. Nothing of the kind. The sale and the purchase constitute one identical act, an exchange between a
      commodity-owner and an owner of money, between two persons as opposed to each other as the two poles of a magnet.
      They form two distinct acts, of polar and opposite characters, when performed by one single person. Hence the identity of sale
      and purchase implies that the commodity is useless, if, on being thrown into the alchemistical retort of circulation, it does not
      come out again in the shape of money; if, in other words, it cannot be sold by its owner, and therefore be bought by the owner
      of the money. That identity further implies that the exchange, if it do take place, constitutes a period of rest, an interval, long or
      short, in the life of the commodity. Since the first metamorphosis of a commodity is at once a sale and a purchase, it is also an
      independent process in itself. The purchaser has the commodity, the seller has the money, i.e., a commodity ready to go into
      circulation at any time. No one can sell unless some one else purchases. But no one is forthwith bound to purchase, because he
      has just sold. Circulation bursts through all restrictions as to time, place, and individuals, imposed by direct barter, and this it
      effects by splitting up, into the antithesis of a sale and a purchase, the direct identity that in barter does exist between the
      alienation of one's own and the acquisition of some other man's product. To say that these two independent and antithetical acts
      have an intrinsic unity, are essentially one, is the same as to say that this intrinsic oneness expresses itself in an external
      antithesis. If the interval in time between the two complementary phases of the complete metamorphosis of a commodity
      become too great, if the split between the sale and the purchase become too pronounced, the intimate connexion between
      them, their oneness, asserts itself by producing — a crisis. The antithesis, use-value and value; the contradictions that private
      labour is bound to manifest itself as direct social labour, that a particularised concrete kind of labour has to pass for abstract
      human labour; the contradiction between the personification of objects and the representation of persons by things; all these
      antitheses and contradictions, which are immanent in commodities, assert themselves, and develop their modes of motion, in the
      antithetical phases of the metamorphosis of a commodity. These modes therefore imply the possibility, and no more than the
      possibility, of crises. The conversion of this mere possibility into a reality is the result of a long series of relations, that, from our
      present standpoint of simple circulation, have as yet no existence. [25] 


                                        B. The currency [26] of money

         The change of form, C—-M—-C, by which the circulation of the material products of labour is brought about, requires that
      a given value in the shape of a commodity shall begin the process, and shall, also in the shape of a commodity, end it. The
      movement of the commodity is therefore a circuit. On the other hand, the form of this movement precludes a circuit from being
      made by the money. The result is not the return of the money, but its continued removal further and further away from its
      starting-point. So long as the seller sticks fast to his money, which is the transformed shape of his commodity, that commodity is
      still in the first phase of its metamorphosis, and has completed only half its course. But so soon as he completes the process, so
      soon as he supplements his sale by a purchase, the money again leaves the hands of its possessor. It is true that if the weaver,
      after buying the Bible, sell more linen, money comes back into his hands. But this return is not owing to the circulation of the
      first 20 yards of linen; that circulation resulted in the money getting into the hands of the seller of the Bible. The return of money
      into the hands of the weaver is brought about only by the renewal or repetition of the process of circulation with a fresh
      commodity, which renewed process ends with the same result as its predecessor did. Hence the movement directly imparted to
      money by the circulation of commodities takes the form of a constant motion away from its starting-point, of a course from the
      hands of one commodity-owner into those of another. This course constitutes its currency (cours de la monnaie). 

         The currency of money is the constant and monotonous repetition of the same process. The commodity is always in the
      hands of the seller; the money, as a means of purchase, always in the hands of the buyer. And money serves as a means of
      purchase by realising the price of the commodity. This realisation transfers the commodity from the seller to the buyer and
      removes the money from the hands of the buyer into those of the seller, where it again goes through the same process with
      another commodity. That this one-sided character of the money's motion arises out of the two-sided character of the
      commodity's motion, is a circumstance that is veiled over. The very nature of the circulation of commodities begets the opposite
      appearance. The first metamorphosis of a commodity is visibly, not only the money's movement, but also that of the commodity
      itself; in the second metamorphosis, on the contrary, the movement appears to us as the movement of the money alone. In the
      first phase of its circulation the commodity changes place with the money. Thereupon the commodity, under its aspect of a
      useful object, falls out of circulation into consumption. [27] In its stead we have its value-shape — the money. It then goes
      through the second phase of its circulation, not under its own natural shape, but under the shape of money. The continuity of the
      movement is therefore kept up by the money alone, and the same movement that as regards the commodity consists of two
      processes of an antithetical character, is, when considered as the movement of the money, always one and the same process, a
      continued change of places with ever fresh commodities. Hence the result brought about by the circulation of-commodities,
      namely, the replacing of one commodity by another, takes the appearance of having been effected not by means of the change
      of form of the commodities but rather by the money acting as a medium of circulation, by an action that circulates commodities,
      to all appearance motionless in themselves, and transfers them from hands in which they are non-use-values, to hands in which
      they are use-values; and that in a direction constantly opposed to the direction of the money. The latter is continually
      withdrawing commodities from circulation and stepping into their places, and in thus way continually moving further and further
      from its starting-point Hence although the movement of the money is merely the expression of the circulation of commodities,
      yet the contrary appears to be the actual fact, and the circulation of commodities seems to be the result of the movement of the
      money. [28] 

         Again, money functions as a means of circulation only because in it the values of commodities have independent reality.
      Hence its movement, as the medium of circulation, is, in fact, merely the movement of commodities while changing their forms.
      This fact must therefore make itself plainly visible in the currency of money. Thus the linen for instance, first of all changes its
      commodity-form into its moneyform. The second term of its first metamorphosis, C—-M, the money form, then becomes the
      first term of its final metamorphosis, M—-C, its re-conversion into the Bible. But each of these two changes of form is
      accomplished by an exchange between commodity and money, by their reciprocal displacement. The same pieces of coin
      come into the seller's hand as the alienated form of the commodity and leave it as the absolutely alienable form of the
      commodity. They are displaced twice. The first metamorphosis of the linen puts these coins into the weaver's pocket, the
      second draws them out of it. The two inverse changes undergone by the same commodity are reflected in the displacement,
      twice repeated, but in opposite directions, of the same pieces of coin. 

         If, on the contrary, only one phase of the metamorphosis is gone through, if there are only sales or only purchases, then a
      given piece of money changes its place only once. Its second change of place always expresses the second metamorphosis of
      the commodity, its re-conversion from money. The frequent repetition of the displacement of the same coins reflects not only
      the series of metamorphoses that a single commodity has gone through, but also the intertwining of the innumerable
      metamorphoses in the world of commodities in general. It is a matter of course, that all this is applicable to the simple circulation
      of commodities alone, the only form that we are now considering. 

         Every commodity, when it first steps into circulation, and undergoes its first change of form, does so only to fall out of
      circulation again and to be replaced by other commodities. Money, on the contrary, as the medium of circulation, keeps
      continually within the sphere of circulation, and moves about in it. The question therefore arises, how much money this sphere
      constantly absorbs? 

         In a given country there take place every day at the same time, but in different localities, numerous one-sided
      metamorphoses of commodities, or, in other words, numerous sales and numerous purchases. The commodities are equated
      beforehand in imagination, by their prices, to definite quantities of money. And since, in the form of circulation now under
      consideration, money and commodities always come bodily face to face, one at the positive pole of purchase, the other at the
      negative pole of sale, it is clear that the amount of the means of circulation required, is determined beforehand by the sum of the
      prices of all these commodities. As a matter of fact, the money in reality represents the quantity or sum of gold ideally
      expressed beforehand by the sum of the prices of the commodities. The equality of these two sums is therefore self-evident.
      We know, however, that, the values of commodities remaining constant, their prices vary with the value of gold (the material of
      money), rising in proportion as it falls, and falling in proportion as it rises. Now if, in consequence of such a rise or fall in the
      value of gold, the sum of the prices of commodities fall or rise, the quantity of money in currency must fall or rise to the same
      extent. The change in the quantity of the circulating medium is, in this case, it is true, caused by the money itself, yet not in virtue
      of its function as a medium of circulation, but of its function as a measure of value. First, the price of the commodities varies
      inversely as the value of the money, and then the quantity of the medium of circulation varies directly as the price of the
      commodities. Exactly the same thing would happen if, for instance, instead of the value of gold falling, gold were replaced by
      silver as the measure of value, or if, instead of the value of silver rising, gold were to thrust silver out from being the measure of
      value. In the one case, more silver would be current than gold was before; in the other case, less gold would be current than
      silver was before. In each case the value of the material of money, i. e., the value of the commodity that serves as the measure
      of value, would have undergone a change, and therefore so, too, would the prices of commodities which express their values in
      money, and so, too, would the quantity of money current whose function it is to realise those prices. We have already seen, that
      the sphere of circulation has an opening through which gold (or the material of money generally) enters into it as a commodity
      with a given value. Hence, when money enters on its functions as a measure of value, when it expresses prices, its value is
      already determined. If now its value fall, this fact is first evidenced by a change in the prices of those commodities that are
      directly bartered for the precious metals at the sources of their production. The greater part of all other commodities, especially
      in the imperfectly developed stages of civil society, will continue for a long time to be estimated by the former antiquated and
      illusory value of the measure of value. Nevertheless, one commodity infects another through their common value-relation, so
      that their prices, expressed in gold or in silver, gradually settle down into the proportions determined by their comparative
      values, until finally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the metal that constitutes money. This
      process is accompanied by the continued increase in the quantity of the precious metals, an increase caused by their streaming
      in to replace the articles directly bartered for them at their sources of production. In proportion therefore as commodities in
      general acquire their true prices, in proportion as their values become estimated according to the fallen value of the precious
      metal, in the same proportion the quantity of that metal necessary for realising those new prices is provided beforehand. A
      one-sided observation of the results that followed upon the discovery of fresh supplies of gold and silver, led some economists
      in the 17th, and particularly in the 18th century, to the false conclusion, that the prices of commodities had gone up in
      consequence of the increased quantity of gold and silver serving as means of circulation. Hence momentarily whenever we
      estimate the price of a commodity. On this supposition then, the quantity of the medium of circulation is determined by the sum
      of the prices that have to be realised. If now we further suppose the price of each commodity to be given, the sum of the prices
      clearly depends on the mass of commodities in circulation. It requires but little racking of brains to comprehend that if one
      quarter of wheat costs £2, 100 quarters will cost £200, 200 quarters £400, and so on, that consequently the quantity of money
      that changes place with the wheat, when sold, must increase with the quantity of that wheat. 

         If the mass of commodities remain constant, the quantity of circulating money varies with the fluctuations in the prices of
      those commodities. It increases and diminishes because the sum of the prices increases or diminishes in consequence of the
      change of price. To produce this effect, it is by no means requisite that the prices of all commodities should rise or fall
      simultaneously. A rise or a fall in the prices of a number of leading articles, is sufficient in the one case to increase, in the other
      to diminish, the sum of the prices of all commodities, and, therefore, to put more or less money in circulation. Whether the
      change in the price correspond to an actual change of value in the commodities, or whether it be the result of mere fluctuations
      in market-prices, the effect on the quantity of the medium of circulation remains the same. Suppose the following articles to be
      sold or partially metamorphosed simultaneously in different localities: say, one quarter of wheat, 20 yards of linen, one Bible,
      and 4 gallons of brandy. If the price of each article be £2, and the sum of the prices to be realised be consequently £8, it
      follows that £8 in money must go into circulation. If, on the other hand, these same articles are links in the following chain of
      metamorphoses: 1 quarter of wheat — £2 — 20 yards of linen — £2 — 1 Bible — £2 — 4 gallons of brandy — £2, a chain
      that is already well known to us, in that case the £2 cause the different commodities to circulate one after the other, and after
      realising their prices successively, and therefore the sum of those prices, £8, they come to rest at last in the pocket of the
      distiller. The £2 thus make four moves. This repeated change of place of the same pieces of money corresponds to the double
      change in form of the commodities, to their motion in opposite directions through two stages of circulation. and to the interlacing
      of the metamorphoses of different commodities. [29] These antithetic and complementary phases, of which the process of
      metamorphosis consists, are gone through, not simultaneously, but successively. Time is therefore required for the completion of
      the series. Hence the velocity of the currency of money is measured by the number of moves made by a given piece of money
      in a given time. Suppose the circulation of the 4 articles takes a day. The sum of the prices to be realised in the day is £8, the
      number of moves of the two pieces of money is four, and the quantity of money circulating is £2. Hence, for a given interval of
      time during the process of circulation, we have the following relation: the quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium
      is equal to the sum of the prices of the commodities divided by the number of moves made by coins of the same denomination.
      This law holds generally. 

         The total circulation of commodities in a given country during a given period is made up on the one hand of numerous
      isolated and simultaneous partial metamorphoses, sales which are at the same time purchases, in which each coin changes its
      place only once, or makes only one move; on the other hand, of numerous distinct series of metamorphoses partly running side
      by side, and partly coalescing with each other, in each of which series each coin makes a number of moves, the number being
      greater or less according to circumstances. The total number of moves made by all the circulating coins of one denomination
      being given, we can arrive at the average number of moves made by a single coin of that denomination, or at the average
      velocity of the currency of money. The quantity of money thrown into the circulation at the beginning of each day is of course
      determined by the sum of the prices of all the commodities circulating simultaneously side by side. But once in circulation, coins
      are, so to say, made responsible for one another. If the one increase its velocity, the other either retards its own, or altogether
      falls out of circulation; for the circulation can absorb only such a quantity of gold as when multiplied by the mean number of
      moves made by one single coin or element, is equal to the sum of the prices to be realised. Hence if the number of moves made
      by the separate pieces increase, the total number of those pieces in circulation diminishes. If the number of the moves diminish,
      the total number of pieces increases. Since the quantity of money capable of being absorbed by the circulation is given for a
      given mean velocity of currency, all that is necessary in order to abstract a given number of sovereigns from the circulation is to
      throw the same number of one-pound notes into it, a trick well known to all bankers. 

         Just as the currency of money, generally considered, is but a reflex of the circulation of commodities, or of the antithetical
      metamorphoses they undergo, so, too, the velocity of that currency reflects the rapidity with which commodities change their
      forms, the continued interlacing of one series of metamorphoses with another, the hurried social interchange of matter, the rapid
      disappearance of commodities from the sphere of circulation, and the equally rapid substitution of fresh ones in their places.
      Hence, in the velocity of the currency we have the fluent unity of the antithetical and complementary phases, the unity of the
      conversion of the useful aspect of commodities into their value-aspect, and their re-conversion from the latter aspect to the
      former, or the unity of the two processes of sale and purchase. On the other hand, the retardation of the currency reflects the
      separation of these two processes into isolated antithetical phases, reflects the stagnation in the change of form, and therefore,
      in the social interchange of matter. The circulation itself, of course, gives no clue to the origin of this stagnation; it merely puts in
      evidence the phenomenon itself. The general public, who, simultaneously with the retardation of the currency, see money
      appear and disappear less frequently at the periphery of circulation, naturally attribute this retardation to a quantitative
      deficiency in the circulating medium. [30] 

         The total quantity of money functioning during a given period as the circulating medium, is determined, on the one hand, by
      the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities, and on the other hand, by the rapidity with which the antithetical phases of
      the metamorphoses follow one another. On this rapidity depends what proportion of the sum of the prices can, on the average,
      be realised by each single coin. But the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities depends on the quantity, as well as on
      the prices, of the commodities. These three factors, however, state of prices, quantity of circulating commodities, and velocity
      of money-currency, are all variable. Hence, the sum of the prices to be realisedj and consequently the quantity of the circulating
      medium depending on that sum, will vary with the numerous variations of these three factors in combination. Of these variations
      we shall consider those alone that have been the most important in the history of prices. 

         While prices remain constant, She quantity of the circulating medium may increase owing to the number of circulating
      commodities increasing, or to the velocity of currency decreasing, or to a combination of the two. On the other hand the
      quantity of the circulating medium may decrease with a decreasing number of commodities, or with an increasing rapidity of
      their circulation. 

         With a general rise in the prices of commodities, the quantity of the circulating medium will remain constant, provided the
      number of commodities in circulation decrease proportionally to the increase in their prices, or provided the velocity of currency
      increase at the same rate as prices rise, the number of commodities in circulation remaining constant. The quantity of the
      circulating medium may decrease, owing to the number of commodities decreasing more rapidly; or to the velocity of currency
      rise. 

         With a general fall in the prices of commodities, the quantity of the circulating medium will remain constant, provided the
      number of commodities increase proportionally to their fall in price, or provided the velocity of currency decrease in the same
      proportion. The quantity of the circulating medium will increase, provided the number of commodities increase quicker, or the
      rapidity of circulation decrease quicker, than the prices fall. 

         The variations of the different factors may mutually compensate each other, so that notwithstanding their continued instability,
      the sum of the prices to be realised and the quantity of money in circulation remain constant; consequently, we find, especially if
      we take long periods into consideration, that the deviations from the average level, of the quantity of money current in any
      country, are much smaller than we should at first sight expect, apart of course from excessive perturbations periodically arising
      from industrial and commercial crises, or less frequently, from fluctuations in the value of money. 

         The law, that the quantity of the circulating medium is determined by the sum of the prices of the commodities circulating,
      and the average increasing more rapidly, than prices velocity of currency [31] may also be stated as follows: given the sum of
      the values of commodities, and the average rapidity of their metamorphoses, the quantity of precious metal current as money
      depends on the value of that precious metal. The erroneous opinion that it is, on the contrary, prices that are determined by the
      quantity of the circulating medium, and that the latter depends on the quantity of the precious metals in a country; [32] this
      opinion was based by those who first held it, on the absurd hypothesis that commodities are without a price, and money without
      a value, when they first enter into circulation, and that, once in the circulation, an aliquot part of the medley of commodities is
      exchanged for an aliquot part of the heap of precious metals. [33] 


                                        C. Coin and symbols of value

         That money takes the shape of coin, springs from its function as the circulating medium. The weight of gold represented in
      imagination by the prices or money-names of commodities, must confront those commodities, within the circulation, in the shape
      of coins or pieces of gold of a given denomination. Coining, like the establishment of a standard of prices, is the business of the
      State. The different national uniforms worn at home by gold and silver as coins, and doffed again in the market of the world,
      indicate the separation between the internal or national spheres of the circulation of commodities, and their universal sphere. 

         The only difference, therefore, between coin and bullion, is one of shape, and gold can at any time pass from one form to the
      other. [34] But no sooner does coin leave the mint, than it immediately finds itself on the high-road to the melting pot. During
      their currency, coins wear away, some more, others less. Name and substance, nominal weight and real weight, begin their
      process of separation. Coins of the same denomination become different in value, because they are different in weight. The
      weight of gold fixed upon as the standard of prices, deviates from the weight that serves as the circulating medium, and the
      latter thereby ceases any longer to be a real equivalent of the commodities whose prices it realises. The history of coinage
      during the middle ages and down into the 18th century, records the ever renewed confusion arising from this cause. The natural
      tendency of circulation to convert coins into a mere semblance of what they profess to be, into a symbol of the weight of metal
      they are officially supposed to contain, is recognised by modern legislation, which fixes the loss of weight sufficient to
      demonetise a gold coin, or to make it no longer legal tender. 

         The fact that the currency of coins itself effects a separation between their nominal and their real weight, creating a distinction
      between them as mere pieces of metal on the one hand, and as coins with a definite function on the other — this fact implies the
      latent possibility of replacing metallic coins by tokens of some other material, by symbols serving the same purposes as coins.
      The practical difficulties in the way of coining extremely minute quantities of gold or silver, and the circumstance that at first the
      less precious metal is used as a measure of value instead of the-more precious, copper instead of silver, silver instead of gold,
      and that the less precious circulates as money until dethroned by the more precious — all these facts explain the parts
      historically played by silver and copper tokens as substitutes for gold coins. Silver and copper tokens take the place of gold in
      those regions of the circulation where coins pass from hand to hand most rapidly, and are subject to the maximum amount of
      wear and tear. This occurs where sales and purchases on a very small scale are continually happening. In order to prevent these
      satellites from establishing themselves permanently in the place of gold, positive enactments determine the extent to which they
      must be compulsorily received as payment instead of gold. The particular tracks pursued by the different species of coin in
      currency, run naturally into each other. The tokens keep company with gold, to pay fractional parts of the smallest gold coin;
      gold is, on the one hand, constantly pouring into retail circulation, and on the other hand is as constantly being thrown out again
      by being changed into tokens. [35] 

         The weight of metal in the silver and copper tokens is arbitrarily fixed by law. When in currency, they wear away even more
      rapidly than gold coins. Hence their functions are totally independent of their weight, and consequently of all value. The function
      of gold as coin becomes completely independent of the metallic value of that gold. Therefore things that are relatively without
      value, such as paper notes, can serve as coins in its place. This purely symbolic character is to a certain extent masked in metal
      tokens. In paper money it stands out plainly. In fact, ce n'est que le premier pas qui coûte. 

         We allude here only to inconvertible paper money issued by the State and having compulsory circulation. It has its
      immediate origin in the metallic currency. Money based upon credit implies on the other hand conditions, which, from our
      standpoint of the simple circulation of commodities, are as yet totally unknown to us. But we may affirm this much, that just as
      true paper money takes its rise in the function of money as the circulating medium, so money based upon credit takes root
      spontaneously in the function of money as the means of payment. [36] 

         The State puts in circulation bits of paper on which their various denominations, say £1, £5, &c., are printed. In so far as
      they actually take the place of gold to the same amount, their movement is subject to the laws that regulate the currency of
      money itself. A law peculiar to the circulation of paper money can spring up only from the proportion in which that paper
      money represents gold. Such a law exists; stated simply, it is as follows: the issue of paper money must not exceed in amount
      the gold (or silver as the case may be) which would actually circulate if not replaced by symbols. Now the quantity of gold
      which the circulation can absorb, constantly-fluctuates about a given level. Still, the mass of the circulating medium in a given
      country never sinks below a certain minimum easily ascertained by actual experience. The fact that this minimum mass
      continually undergoes changes in its constituent parts, or that the pieces of gold of which it consists are being constantly
      replaced by fresh ones, causes of course no change either in its amount or in the continuity of its circulation. It can therefore be
      replaced by paper symbols. If, on the other hand, all the conduits of circulation were to-day filled with paper money to the full
      extent of their capacity for absorbing money, they might to-morrow be overflowing in consequence of a fluctuation in the
      circulation of commodities. There would no longer be any standard. If the paper money exceed its proper limit, which is the
      amount in gold coins of the like denomination that can actually be current, it would, apart from the danger of falling into general
      disrepute, represent only that quantity of gold, which, in accordance with the laws of the circulation of commodities, is required,
      and is alone capable of being represented by paper. If the quantity of paper money issued be double what it ought to be, then,
      as a matter of fact, £1 would be the money-name not of 1/4 of an ounce, but of 1/8 of an ounce of gold. The effect would be
      the same as if an alteration had taken place in the function of gold as a standard of prices. Those values that were previously
      expressed by the price of £1 would now be expressed by the price of £2. 

         Paper money is a token representing gold or money. The relation between it and the values of commodities is this, that the
      latter are ideally expressed in the same quantities of gold that are symbolically represented by the paper. Only in so far as paper
      money represents gold, which like all other commodities has value, is it a symbol of value. [37] 

         Finally, some one may ask why gold is capable of being replaced by tokens that have no value? But, as we have already
      seen, it is capable of being so replaced only in so &r as it functions exclusively as coin, or as the circulating medium, and as
      nothing else. Now, money has other functions besides this one, and the isolated function of serving as the mere circulating
      medium is not necessarily the only one attached to gold coin, although this is the case with those abraded coins that continue to
      circulate. Each piece of money is a mere coin, or means of circulation, only so long as it actually circulates. But this is just the
      case with that minimum mass of gold, which is capable of being replaced by paper money. That mass remains constantly within
      the sphere of circulation, continually functions as a circulating medium, and exists exclusively for that purpose. Its movement
      therefore represents nothing but the continued alternation of the inverse phases of the metamorphosis C—-M—-C, phases in
      which commodities confront their value-forms, only to disappear again immediately. The independent existence of the
      exchange-value of a commodity is here a transient apparition, by means of which the commodity is immediately replaced by
      another commodity. Hence, in this process which continually makes money pass from hand to hand, the mere symbolical
      existence of money suffices. Its functional existence absorbs, so to say, its material existence. Being a transient and objective
      reflex of the prices of commodities, it serves only as a symbol of itself, and is therefore capable of being replaced by a token.
      [38] One thing is, however, requisite; this token must have an objective social validity of its own, and this the paper symbol
      acquires by its forced currency. This compulsory action of the State can take effect only within that inner sphere of circulation
      which is coterminous with the territories of the community, but it is also only within that sphere that money completely responds
      to its function of being the circulating medium, or becomes coin. 

          




                                          SECTION 3

                                                  MONEY




          

         The commodity that functions as a measure of value, and, either in its own person or by a representative, as the medium of
      circulation, is money. Gold (or silver) is therefore money. It functions as money, on the one hand, when it has to be present in
      its own golden person. It is then the money-commodity, neither merely ideal, as in its function of a measure of value, nor
      capable of being represented, as in its function of circulating medium. On the other hand, it also functions as money, when by
      virtue of its function, whether that function be performed in person or by representative, it congeals into the sole form of value,
      the only adequate form of existence of exchange-value, in opposition to use-value, represented by all other commodities. 


                                                 A. Hoarding

         The continual movement in circuits of the two antithetical metamorphoses of commodities, or the never ceasing alternation of
      sale and purchase, is reflected in the restless currency of money, or in the function that money performs of a perpetuum mobile
      of circulation. But so soon as the series of metamorphoses is interrupted, so soon as sales are not supplemented by subsequent
      purchases, money ceases to be mobilised; it is transformed, as Boisguillebert says, from "meuble" into "immouble", from
      movable into immovable, from coin into money. 

         With the very earliest development of the circulation of commodities, there is also developed the necessity, and the
      passionate desire, to hold fast the product of the first metamorphosis. This product is the transformed shape of the commodity,
      or its gold-chrysalis. [39] Commodities are thus sold not for the purpose of buying others, but in order to replace their
      commodity-form by their money-form. From being the mere means of effecting the circulation of commodities, this change of
      form becomes the end and aim. The changed form of the commodity is thus prevented from functioning as its unconditionally
      alienable form, or as its merely transient money-form. The money becomes petrified into a hoard, and the seller becomes a
      hoarder of money. 

         In the early stages of the circulation of commodities, it is the surplus use-values alone that are converted into money. Gold
      and silver thus become of themselves social expressions for superfluity or wealth. This naive form of hoarding becomes
      perpetuated in those communities in which the traditional mode of production is carried on for the supply of a fixed and limited
      circle of home wants. It is thus with the people of Asia, and particularly of the East Indies. Vanderlint, who fancies that the
      prices of commodities in a country are determined by the quantity of gold and silver to be found in it, asks himself why Indian
      commodities are so cheap. Answer: Because the Hindus bury their money. From 1602 to 1734, he remarks, they buried 150
      millions of pounds sterling of silver, which originally came from America to Europe. [40] In the 10 years from 1856 to 1866,
      England exported to India and China (120,000,000 in silver, which had been received in exchange for Australian gold. Most of
      the silver exported to China makes its way to India. 

         As the production of commodities further develops, every producer of commodities is compelled. to make sure of the nexus
      rerum or the social pledge. [41] His wants are constantly making themselves felt, and necessitate the continual purchase of
      other people's commodities, while the production and sale of his own goods require time, and depend upon circumstances. In
      order then to be able to buy without selling, he must have sold previously without buying. This operation, conducted on a
      general scale, appears to imply a contradiction. But the precious metals at the sources of their production are directly
      exchanged for other commodities. And here we have sales (by the owners of commodities) without purchases (by the owners
      of gold or silver). [42] And subsequent sales, by other producers, unfollowed by purchases, merely bring about the distribution
      of the newly produced precious metals among all the owners of commodities. In this way, all along the line of exchange, hoards
      of gold and silver of varied extent are accumulated. With the possibility of holding and storing up exchange-value in the shape of
      a particular commodity, arises also the greed for gold. Along with the extension of circulation, increases the power of money,
      that absolutely social form of wealth ever ready for use. "Gold is a wonderful thing! Whoever possesses it is lord of all he
      wants. By means of gold one can even get souls into Paradise." (Columbus in his letter from Jamaica, 1503.) Since gold does
      not disclose what has been transformed into it, everything, commodity or not, is convertible into gold. Everything becomes
      saleable and buyable. The circulation becomes the great social retort into which everything is thrown, to come out again as a
      gold-crystal. Not even are the bones of saints, and still less are more delicate res sacrosanctae, extra commercium hominum
      able to withstand this alchemy. [43] Just as every qualitative difference between commodities is extinguished in money, so
      money, on its side, like the radical leveller that it is, does away with all distinctions. [43a] But money itself is a commodity, an
      external object, capable of becoming the private property of any individual. Thus social power becomes the private power of
      private persons. The ancients therefore denounced money as subversive of the economic and moral order of things. [43b]
      Modern society, which, soon after its birth, pulled Plutus by the hair of his head from the bowels of the earth, [44] greets gold
      as its Holy Grail, as the glittering incarnation of the very principle of its own life. 

         A commodity, in its capacity of a use-value, satisfies a particular want, and is a particular element of material wealth. But the
      value of a commodity measures the degree of its attraction for all other elements of material wealth, and therefore measures the
      social wealth of its owner. To a barbarian owner of commodities, and even to a West-European peasant, value is the same as
      value-form, and therefore. to him the increase in his hoard of gold and silver is an increase in value. It is true that the value of
      money varies, at one time in consequence of a variation in its own value, at another, in consequence of a change in the values of
      commodities. But this, on the one hand, does not prevent 200 ounces of gold from still containing more value than 100 ounces,
      nor, on the other hand, does it hinder the actual metallic form of this article from continuing to be the universal equivalent form
      of all other commodities, and the immediate social incarnation of all human labour. The desire after hoarding is in its very nature
      unsatiable. In its qualitative aspect, or formally considered, money has no bounds to its efficacy, i.e., it is the universal
      representative of material wealth, because it is directly convertible into any other commodity. But, at the same time, every actual
      sum of money is limited in amount, and, therefore, as a means of purchasing, has only a limited efficacy. This antagonism
      between the quantitative limits of money and its qualitative boundlessness, continually acts as a spur to the hoarder in his
      Sisyphus-like labour of accumulating. It is with him as it is with a conqueror who sees in every new country annexed, only a
      new boundary. 

         In order that gold may be held as money, and made to form a hoard, it must be prevented from circulating, or from
      transforming itself into a means of enjoyment. The hoarder, therefore, makes a sacrifice of the lusts of the flesh to his gold fetish.
      He acts in earnest up to the Gospel of abstention. On the other hand, he can withdraw from circulation no more than what he
      has thrown into it in the shape of commodities. The more he produces, the more he is able to sell. Hard work, saving, and
      avarice are, therefore, his three cardinal virtues, and to sell much and buy little the sum of his political economy. [45] 

         By the side of the gross form of a hoard, we find also its aesthetic form in the possession of gold and silver articles. This
      grows with the wealth of civil society. "Soyons riches ou paraissons riches" (Diderot). 

         In this way there is created, on the one hand, a constantly extending market for gold and silver, unconnected with their
      functions as money, and, on the other hand, a latent source of supply, to which recourse is had principally in times of crisis and
      social disturbance. 

         Hoarding serves various purposes in the economy of the metallic circulation. Its first function arises out of the conditions to
      which the currency of gold and silver coins is subject. We have seen how, along with the continual fluctuations in the extent and
      rapidity of the circulation of commodities and in their prices, the quantity of money current unceasingly ebbs and flows. This
      mass must, therefore, be capable of expansion and contraction. At one time money must be attracted in order to act as
      circulating coin, at another, circulating coin must be repelled in order to act again as more or less stagnant money. In order that
      the mass of money, actually current, may constantly saturate the absorbing power of the circulation, it is necessary that the
      quantity of gold and silver in a country be greater than the quantity required to function as coin. This condition is fulfilled by
      money taking the form of hoards. These reserves serve as conduits for the supply or withdrawal of money to or from the
      circulation, which in this way never overflows its banks. [46] 


                                            B. Means of Payment

         In the simple form of the circulation of commodities hitherto considered, we found a given value always presented to us in a
      double shape, as a commodity at one pole, as money at the opposite pole. The owners of commodities came therefore into
      contact as the respective representatives of what were already equivalents. But with the development of circulation, conditions
      arise under which the alienation of commodities becomes separated, by an interval of time, from the realisation of their prices. It
      will be sufficient to indicate the most simple of these conditions. One sort of article requires a longer, another a shorter time for
      its production. Again, the production of different commodities depends on different seasons of the year. One sort of commodity
      may be born on its own market place, another has to make a long journey to market. Commodity-owner No. 1, may therefore
      be ready to sell, before No. 2 is ready to buy. When the same transactions are continually repeated between the same persons,
      the conditions of sale are regulated in accordance with the conditions of production. On the other hand, the use of a given
      commodity, of a house, for instance, is sold (in common parlance, let) for a definite period. Here, it is only at the end of the
      term that the buyer has actually received the use-value of the commodity. He therefore buys it before he pays for it. The vendor
      sells an existing commodity, the purchaser buys as the mere representative of money, or rather of future money. The vendor
      becomes a creditor, the purchaser becomes a debtor. Since the metamorphosis of commodities, or the development of their
      value-form, appears here under a new aspect, money also acquires a fresh function; it becomes the means of payment. 

         The character of creditor, or of debtor, results here from the simple circulation. The change in the form of that circulation
      stamps buyer and seller with this new die. At first, therefore, these new parts are just as transient and alternating as those of
      seller and buyer, and are in turns played by the same actors. But the opposition is not nearly so pleasant, and is far more
      capable of crystallisation. [47] The same characters can, however, be assumed independently of the circulation of commodities.
      The class-struggles of the ancient world took the form chiefly of a contest between debtors and creditors, which in Rome
      ended in the ruin of the plebeian debtors. They were displaced by slaves. In the middle ages the contest ended with the ruin of
      the feudal debtors, who lost their political power together with the economic basis on which it was established. Nevertheless,
      the money relation of debtor and creditor that existed at these two periods reflected only the deeper-lying antagonism between
      the general economic conditions of existence of the classes in question. 

         Let us return to the circulation of commodities. The appearance of the two equivalents, commodities and money, at the two
      poles of the process of sale, has ceased to be simultaneous. The money functions now, first as a measure of value in the
      determination of the price of the commodity sold; the price fixed by the contract measures the obligation of the debtor, or the
      sum of money that he has to pay at a fixed date. Secondly, it serves as an ideal means of purchase. Although existing only in the
      promise of the buyer to pay, it causes the commodity to change hands. It is not before the day fixed for payment that the means
      of payment actually steps into circulation, leaves the hand of the buyer for that of the seller. The circulating medium was
      transformed into a hoard, because the process stopped short after the first phase, because the converted shape of the
      commodity, viz., the money, was withdrawn from circulation. The means of payment enters the circulation, but only after the
      commodity has left it. The money is no longer the means that brings about the process. It only brings it to a close, by stepping in
      as the absolute form of existence of exchange-value, or as the universal commodity. The seller turned his commodity into
      money, in order thereby to satisfy some want, the hoarder did the same in order to keep his commodity in its money-shape,
      and the debtor in order to be able to pay; if he do not pay, his goods will be sold by the sheriff. The value-form of
      commodities, money, is therefore now the end and aim of a sale, and that owing to a social necessity springing out of the
      process of circulation itself. 

         The buyer converts money back into commodities before he has turned commodities into money: in other words, he
      achieves the second metamorphosis of commodities before the first. The seller's commodity circulates, and realises its price, but
      only in the shape of a legal claim upon money. It is converted into a use-value before it has been converted into money. The
      completion of its first metamorphosis follows only at a later period. [48] 

         The obligations falling due within a given period, represent the sum of the prices of the commodities, the sale of which gave
      rise to those obligations. The quantity of gold necessary to realise this sum, depends, in the first instance, on the rapidity of
      currency of the means of payment. That quantity is conditioned by two circumstances: first the relations between debtors and
      creditors form a sort of chain, in such a way that A, when he receives money from his debtor B, straightway hands it over to C
      his creditor, and so on; the second circumstance is the length of the intervals between the different due-days of the obligations.
      The continuous chain of payments, or retarded first metamorphoses, is essentially different from that interlacing of the series of
      metamorphoses which we considered on a former page. By the currency of the circulating medium, the connexion between
      buyers and sellers, is not merely expressed. This connexion is originated by, and exists in, the circulation alone. Contrariwise,
      the movement of the means of payment expresses a social relation that was in existence long before. 

         The fact that a number of sales take place simultaneously, and side by side, limits the extent to which coin can be replaced
      by the rapidity of currency. On the other hand, this fact is a new lever in economising the means of payment. In proportion as
      payments are concentrated at one spot, special institutions and methods are developed for their liquidation. Such in the middle
      ages were the virements at Lyons. The debts due to A from B, to B from C, to C from A, and so on, have only to be
      confronted with each other, in order to annul each other to a certain extent like positive and negative quantities. There thus
      remains only a single balance to pay. The greater the amount of the payments concentrated, the less is this balance relatively to
      that amount, and the less is the mass of the means of payment in circulation. 

         The function of money as the means of payment implies a contradiction without a terminus medius. In so far as the payments
      balance one another, money functions only ideally as money of account, as a measure of value. In so far as actual payments
      have to be made, money does not serve as a circulating medium, as a mere transient agent in the interchange of products, but as
      the individual incarnation of social labour, as the independent form of existence of exchange-value, as the universal commodity.
      This contradiction comes to a head in those phases of industrial and commercial crises which are known as monetary crises.
      [49] Such a crisis occurs only where the ever-lengthening chain of payments, and an artificial system of settling them, has been
      fully developed. Whenever there is a general and extensive disturbance of this mechanism, no matter what its cause, money
      becomes suddenly and immediately transformed, from its merely ideal shape of money of account, into hard cash. Profane
      commodities can no longer replace it. The use-value of commodities becomes valueless, and their value vanishes in the
      presence of its own independent form. On the eve of the crisis, the bourgeois, with the self-sufficiency that springs from
      intoxicating prosperity, declares money to be a vain imagination. Commodities alone are money. But now the cry is everywhere:
      money alone is a commodity! As the hart pants after fresh water, so pants his soul after money, the only wealth. [50] In a crisis,
      the antithesis between commodities and their value-form, money, becomes heightened into an absolute contradiction. Hence, in
      such events, the form under which money appears is of no importance. The money famine continues, whether payments have to
      be made in gold or in credit money such as bank-notes. [51] 

         If we now consider the sum total of the money current during a given period, we shall find that, given the rapidity of currency
      of the circulating medium and of the means of payment, it is equal to the sum of the prices to be realised, plus the sum of the
      payments falling due, minus the payments that balance each other, minus finally the number of circuits in which the same piece of
      coin serves in turn as means of circulation and of payment. Hence, even when prices, rapidity of currency, and the extent of the
      economy in payments, are given, the quantity of money current and the mass of commodities circulating during a given period,
      such as a day, no longer correspond. Money that represents commodities long withdrawn from circulation, continues to be
      current. Commodities circulate, whose equivalent in money will not appear on the scene till some future day. Moreover, the
      debts contracted each day, and the payments falling due on the same day, are quite incommensurable quantities. [52] 

         Credit-money springs directly out of the function of money as a means of payment. Certificates of the debts owing for the
      purchased commodities circulate for the purpose of transferring those debts to others. On the other hand, to the same extent as
      the system of credit is extended, so is the function of money as a means of payment. In that character it takes various forms
      peculiar to itself under which it makes itself at home in the sphere of great commercial transactions. Gold and silver coin, on the
      other hand, are mostly relegated to the sphere of retail trade. [53] 

         When the production of commodities has sufficiently extended itself, money begins to serve as the means of payment
      beyond the sphere of the circulation of commodities. It becomes the commodity that is the universal subject-matter of all
      contracts. [54] Rents, taxes, and such like payments are transformed from payments in kind into money payments. To what
      extent this transformation depends upon the general conditions of production, is shown, to take one example, by the fact that
      the Roman Empire twice failed in its attempt to levy all contributions in money. The unspeakable misery of the French
      agricultural population under Louis XIV., a misery so eloquently denounced by Boisguillebert, Marshal Vauban, and others,
      was due not only to the weight of the taxes, but also to the conversion of taxes in kind into money taxes. [55] In Asia, on the
      other hand, the fact that state taxes are chiefly composed of rents payable in kind, depends on conditions of production that are
      reproduced with the regularity of natural phenomena. And this mode of payment tends in its turn to maintain the ancient form of
      production. It is one of the secrets of the conservation of the Ottoman Empire. If the foreign trade, forced upon Japan by
      Europeans, should lead to the substitution of money rents for rents in kind, it will be all up with the exemplary agriculture of that
      country. The narrow economic conditions under which that agriculture is carried on, will be swept away. 

         In every country, certain days of the year become by habit recognised settling days for various large and recurrent
      payments. These dates depend, apart from other revolutions in the wheel of reproduction, on conditions closely connected with
      the seasons. They also regulate the dates for payments that have no direct connexion with the circulation of commodities such
      as taxes, rents, and so on. The quantity of money requisite to make the-payments, falling due on those dates all over the
      country, causes periodical, though merely superficial, perturbations in the economy of the medium of payment. [56] 

         From the law of the rapidity of currency of the means of payment, it follows that the quantity of the means of payment
      required for all periodical payments, whatever their source, is in inverse [57] proportion to the length of their periods. [58] 

         The development of money into a medium of payment makes it necessary to accumulate money against the dates fixed for
      the payment of the sums owing. While hoarding, as a distinct mode of acquiring riches, vanishes with the progress of civil
      society, the formation of reserves of the means of payment grows with that progress. 


                                             C. Universal Money

         When money leaves the home sphere of circulation, it strips off the local garbs which it there assumes, of a standard of
      prices, of coin, of tokens, and of a symbol of value, and returns to its original form of bullion. In the trade between the markets
      of the world, the value of commodities is expressed so as to be universally recognised. Hence their independent value-form
      also, in these cases, confronts them under the shape of universal money. It is only in the markets of the world that money
      acquires to the full extent the character of the commodity whose bodily form is also the immediate social incarnation of human
      labour in the abstract. Its real mode of existence in this sphere adequately corresponds to its ideal concept. 

         Within the sphere of home circulation, there can be but one commodity which, by serving as a measure of value, becomes
      money. In the markets of the world a double measure of value holds sway, gold and silver. [59] 

         Money of the world serves as the universal medium of payment, as the universal means of purchasing, and as the universally
      recognised embodiment of all wealth. Its function as a means of payment in the settling of international balances is its chief one.
      Hence the watchword of the mercantilists, balance of trade. [60] Gold and silver serve as international means of purchasing
      chiefly and necessarily in those periods when the customary equilibrium in the interchange of products between different nations
      is suddenly disturbed. And lastly, it serves as the universally recognised embodiment of social wealth, whenever the question is
      not of buying or paying, but of transferring wealth from one country to another, and whenever this transference in the form of
      commodities is rendered impossible, either by special conjunctures in the markets or by the purpose itself that is intended. [61] 

         Just as every country needs a reserve of money for its home circulation so, too, it requires one for external circulation in the
      markets of the world. The functions of hoards, therefore, arise in part out of the function of money, as the medium of the home
      circulation and home payments, and in part out of its function of money of the world. [62] For this latter function, the genuine
      money-commodity, actual gold and silver, is necessary. On that account, Sir James Steuart, in order to distinguish them from
      their purely local substitutes, calls gold and silver "money of the world." 

         The current of the stream of gold and silver is a double one. On the one hand, it spreads itself from its sources over all the
      markets of the world, in order to become absorbed, to various extents, into the different national spheres of circulation, to fill
      the conduits of currency, to replace abraded gold and silver coins, to supply the material of articles of luxury, and to petrify into
      hoards. [63] This first current is started by the countries that exchange their labour, realised in commodities, for the labour
      embodied in the precious metals by gold and silver-producing countries. On the other hand, there is a continual flowing
      backwards and forwards of gold and silver between the different national spheres of circulation, a current whose motion
      depends on the ceaseless fluctuations in the course of exchange. [64] 

         Countries in which the bourgeois form of production is developed to a certain extent, limit the hoards concentrated in the
      strong rooms of the banks to the minimum required for the proper performance of their peculiar functions. [65] Whenever these
      hoards are strikingly above their average level, it is, with some exceptions, an indication of stagnation in the circulation of
      commodities, of an interruption in the even flow of their metamorphoses. [66] 

                                                         



                                                 Footnotes

      [1] The question — Why does not money directly represent labour-time, so that a piece of paper may represent, for instance, x
      hours' labour, is at bottom the same as the question why, given the production of commodities, must products take the form of
      commodities? This is evident, since their taking the form of commodities implies their differentiation into commodities and
      money. Or, why cannot private labour — labour for the account of private individuals — be treated as its opposite, immediate
      social labour? I have elsewhere examined thoroughly the Utopian idea of "labour-money" in a society founded on the
      production of commodities (l. c., p. 61, seq.). On this point I will only say further, that Owen's "labour-money," for instance, is
      no more "money" than a ticket for the theatre. Owen pre-supposes directly associated labour, a form of production that is
      entirely in consistent with the production of commodities. The certificate of labour is merely evidence of the part taken by the
      individual in the common labour, and of his right to a certain portion of the common produce destined for consumption. But it
      never enters into Owen's head to pre-suppose the production of commodities, and at the same time, by juggling with money, to
      try to evade the necessary conditions of that production. 

      [2] Savages and half-civilised races use the tongue differently. Captain Parry says of the inhabitants on the west coast of
      Baffin's Bay: "In this case (he refers to barter) they licked it (the thing represented to them) twice to their tongues, after which
      they seemed to consider the bargain satisfactorily concluded." In the same way, the Eastern Esquimaux licked the articles they
      received in exchange. If the tongue is thus used in the North as the organ of appropriation, no wonder that, in the South, the
      stomach serves as the organ of accumulated property, and that a Kaffir estimates the wealth of a man by the size of his belly.
      That the Kaffirs know what they are about is shown by the following: at the same time that the official British Health Report of
      1864 disclosed the deficiency of fat-forming food among a large part of the working-class, a certain Dr. Harvey (not, however,
      the celebrated discoverer of the circulation of the blood), made a good thing by advertising recipes for reducing the superfluous
      fat of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy. 

      [3] See Karl Marx: "Zur Kritik, &c." "Theorien von der Masseinheit des Gelda," p. 53, seq. 

      [4] "Wherever gold and silver have by law been made to perform the function of money or of a measure of value side by side, it
      has always been tried, but in vain, to treat them as one and the same material. To assume that there is an invariable ratio
      between the quantities of gold and silver in which a given quantity of labour-time is incorporated, is to assume in fact, that gold
      and silver are of one and the same material, and that a given mass of the less valuable metal, silver, is a constant fraction of a
      given mass of gold. From the reign of Edward III. to the time of George II., The history of money in England consists of one
      long series of perturbations caused by the clashing of the legally fixed ratio between The values of gold and silver, with the
      fluctuations in their real values. At one time gold was too high, at another, silver. The metal that for the time being was estimated
      below its value, was withdrawn from circulation, mated and exported. The ratio between the two metals was then again altered
      by law, but the new nominal ratio soon came into conflict again with the real one. In our own times, the slight and transient fall in
      the value of gold compared with silver, which was a consequence of The Indo-Chinese demand for silver, produced on a far
      more extended scale in France the same phenomena, export of silver, and its expulsion from circulation by gold. During the
      years 1855, 1856 and 1857, the excess in France of gold-imports over gold-exports amounted to £41,580,000, while the
      excess of silver-exports over silver-imports was £14,704,000. In fact, in those countries in which both metals are legally
      measures of value, and therefore both legal tender so that everyone has the option of paying in either metal, the metal That rise
      in value is at a premium, and, like every other commodity, measures its price in the over-estimated metal which alone serve in
      reality as The standard of value. The result of all experience and history with regard to this equation is simply that, where two
      commodities perform by law the functions of a measure of value, in practice one alone maintains that position." (Karl Marx, l.
      c., pp. 52, 53.) 

      [5] The peculiar circumstance, that while the ounce of gold serves in England as the unit of the standard of money, the pound
      sterling does not form an aliquot part of it, has been explained as follows: "Our coinage was originally adapted to the
      employment of silver only, hence, an ounce of silver can always be divided into a certain adequate number of pieces of coin,
      but as gold was introduced at a later period into a coinage adapted only to silver, an ounce of gold cannot be coined into an
      aliquot number of pieces." Maclaren, "A Sketch of the History of the Currency." London, 1858, p. 16. 

      [6] With English writers the confusion between measure of value and standard of price (standard of value! is indescribable.
      Their functions, as well as their names, are constantly interchanged. 

      [7] Moreover, it has not general historical validity. 

      [8] It is thus that the pound sterling in English denotes less than one-third of its original weight; the pound Scot, before the
      union, only 1-36th; the French livre, 1-74th; the Spanish maravedi, less than 1-1,000th; and the Portuguese rei a still smaller
      fraction. 

      [9] "Le monete le quali oggi sono ideal) sono le piû antiche d'ogni nazione, e tutte furono un tempo real), e perche erano reali
      con esse si contava" (Galiani: Della moneta, l. c., p. 153.) 

      [10] David Urquhart remarks in his "Familiar Words" on the monstrosity (!) that now-a-days a pound (sterling), which is the
      unit of the English standard of money, is equal to about a quarter of an ounce of gold. "This is falsifying a measure, not
      establishing a standard." He sees in this "false denomination" of the weight of gold, as in everything else. the falsifying hand of
      civilisation. 

      [11] When Anacharsis was asked for what purposes the Greeks used money, he replied, "For reckoning." (Ashen. Deipn. 1.
      iv. 49 v. 2. ed. Schweighauser, 1802.) 

      [12] "Owing to the fact that money, when serving as the standard of price, appears under the same reckoning names as do the
      prices of commodities, and that therefore the sum of £3 17s. 10 1/2d. may signify on the one hand an ounce weight of gold,
      and on the other, the value of a ton of iron, this reckoning name of money has been called its mint-price. Hence there sprang up
      the extraordinary notion, that the value of gold is estimated in its own material, and that, in contradistinction to all other
      commodities, its price is fixed by the State. It was erroneously thought that the giving of reckoning names to definite weights of
      gold, is the same thing as fixing the value of those weights." (Karl Marx, l. c., p. 52.) 

      [13] See "Theorien von der Masseinheit des Geldes" in "Zur Kritik der Poll Oekon. &c.," p. 53, seq. The fantastic notions
      about raising or lowering the mint-price of money by transferring to greater or smaller weights of gold or silver, the names
      already legally appropriated to fixed weights of those metals; such notions, at least in those cases in which they aim, not at
      clumsy financial operations against creditors, both public and private but at economic quack remedies, have been so
      exhaustively treated by Wm. Petty in his "Quantulumcunque concerning money: To the Lord Marquis of Halifax, 1682," that
      even his immediate followers, Sir Dudley North and John Locke, not to mention later ones, could only dilute him. "If the wealth
      of a nation " he remarks, "could be decupled by a proclamation, it were strange that such proclamations have not long since
      been made by our Governors." (l. c., p. 36.)

      [15] Jerome had to wrestle hard, not only in his youth with the bodily flesh, as is shown by his fight in the desert with the
      handsome women of his imagination, but also in his old age with the spiritual flesh. "I thought," he says, "I was in the spirit
      before the Judge of the Universe." "Who art thou?" asked a voice. "I am a Christian." "Thou liest," thundered back the great
      Judge, "thou art nought but a Ciceronian."

      value of each single yard is but the materialised form of a part of the social labour expended on the whole number of yards." An
      analogous correction was made in a copy of the second German edition of the first volume of "Capital" belonging to Marx;

      [25] See my observations on James Mill in "Zur Kritik, &c.," pp. 74-76. With regard to this subject, we may notice two
      methods characteristic of apologetic economy. The first is the identification of the circulation of commodities with the direct
      barter of products, by simple abstraction from their points of difference; the second is, the attempt to explain away the
      contradictions of capitalist production, by reducing the relations between the persons engaged in that mode of production, to
      the simple relations arising out of the circulation of commodities. The production and circulation of commodities are however,
      phenomena that occur to a greater or less extent in modes of production the most diverse. If we are acquainted with nothing but
      the abstract categories of circulation, which are common to all these modes of production, we cannot possibly know anything
      of the specific points of difference of those modes, nor pronounce any judgment upon them. In no science is such a big fuss
      made with commonplace truisms as in Political Economy. For instance, J. B. Say sets himself up as a judge of crises, because,
      forsooth, he knows that a commodity is a product. 

      [26] Translator's note. — This word is here used in its original signification of the course or track pursued by money as it
      changes from hand to hand, a course which essentially differs from circulation. 

      [27] Even when the commodity is sold over and over again, a phenomenon that at present has no existence for us, it falls, when
      definitely sold for the last time, out of the sphere of circulation into that of consumption, where it serves either as means of
      subsistence or means of production. 

      [28] "Il (l'argent) n'a d'autre mouvement que celui qui lui est imprimé par les productions." (Le Trosne, l. c., p. 885.) 

      [29] "Ce sont les productions qui le (I'argent) mettent en mouvement et le font circuler ... La céléritè de son mouvement (sc. de
      l'argent) supplée à sa quantité. Lorsqu'il en est besoin. il ne fait que glisser d'une main dans l'autre sans s'arrêter un instant." (Le
      Trosne, l. c.. pp. 915, 916.) 

      [30] "Money being ... the common measure of buying and selling, everybody who hath anything to sell, and cannot procure
      chapmen for it, is presently apt to think, that want of money in the. kingdom, or country, is the cause why his goods do not go
      off; and so, want of money is the common cry; which is a great mistake... What do these people want, who cry out for money?
      ... The farmer complains ... he thinks that were more money in the country; he should have a price for his goods. Then it seems
      money is not his want, but a price for his corn and cattel, which he would sell, but cannot... Why cannot he get a price? ... (1)
      Either there is too much corn and cattel in the country, so that most who come to market have need of selling, as he hash, and
      few of buying; or (2) There wants the usual vent abroad by transportation..., or (3) The consumption fails, as when men, by
      reason of poverty, do not spend so much in their houses as formerly they did; wherefore it is not the increase of specific money,
      which would at all advance the farmer's goods, but the removal of any of these three causes, which do truly keep down the
      market... The merchant and shopkeeper want money in the same manner, that is, they want a vent for the goods they deal in,
      by reason that the markets fail"... [A nation] "never thrives better, than when riches are tost from hand to hand." (Sir Dudley
      North: "Discourses upon Trade," Lond. 1691, pp. 11-15, passim.) Herrenschwand's fanciful notions amount merely to this, that
      the antagonism, which has its origin in the nature of commodities, and is reproduced in their circulation, can be removed by
      increasing the circulating medium. But if, on the one hand, it is a popular delusion to ascribe stagnation in production and
      circulation to insufficiency of the circulating medium, it by no means follows, on the other hand, that an actual paucity of the
      medium in consequence, e.g., of bungling legislative interference with the regulation of currency, may not give rise to such
      stagnation. 

      [31] "There is a certain measure and proportion of money requisite to drive the trade of a nation, more or less than which
      would prejudice the same. lust as there is a certain proportion of farthings necessary in a small retail trade, to change silver
      money, and to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest silver pieces.... Now, as the proportion of the
      number of farthings requisite in commerce is to be taken from the number of people, the frequency of their exchanges: as also,
      and principally, from the value of the smallest silver pieces of money; so in like manner, the proportion of money [gold and
      silver specie] requisite in our trade, is to be likewise taken from the frequency of commutations, and from the bigness of the
      payments." (William Petty, "A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions." Lond. 1667, p. 17.) The Theory of Hume was defended
      against the attacks of J. Steuart and others, by A. Young, in his "Political Arithmetic," Lond; 1774, in which work there is a
      special chapter entitled "Prices depend on quantity of money, at p. 112, sqq. I have stated in "Zur Kritik, &c.," p. 149: "He
      (Adam Smith) passes over without remark the question as to the quantity of coin in circulation, and treats money quite wrongly
      as a mere commodity." This statement applies only in so far as Adam Smith, ex officio, treats of money. Now and then,
      however, as in his criticism of the earlier systems of Political Economy, he takes the right view. "The quantity of coin in every
      country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by It.... The value of the goods annually bought
      and sold in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper consumers, and can
      give employment to no more. The channel of circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never admits any
      more." ("Wealth of Nations." Bk. IV., ch. 1.) In like manner, ex officio, he opens his work with an apotheosis on the division of
      labour. Afterwards, in the last book which treats of the sources of public revenue, he occasionally repeats the denunciations of
      the division of labour made by his teacher, A. Ferguson. 

      [32] "The prices of things will certainly rise in every nation, as the gold and silver increase amongst the people, and
      consequently, where the gold and silver decrease in any nation, the prices of all things must fall proportionately to such decrease
      of money." (Jacob Vanderlint: "Money Answers all Things." Lond. 1734, p. 5.) A careful comparison of thus book with
      Hume's "Essays," proves to my mind without doubt that Hume was acquainted with and made use of Vanderlint's work, which
      is certainly an important one. The opinion that prices are determined by the quantity of the circulating medium, was also held by
      Barbon and other much earlier writers. "No inconvenience," says Vanderlint, "can arise by an unrestrained trade, but very great
      advantage; since, if the cash of the nation be decreased by it, which prohibitions are designed to prevent, those nations that get
      the cash will certainly find everything advance in price, as the cash increases amongst them. And ... our manufactures, and
      everything else, will soon become so moderate as to turn the balance of trade in our favour, and thereby fetch the money back
      again." (l. c.. pp. 43, 44.) 

      [33] That the price of each single kind of commodity forms a pan of the sum of the prices of all the commodities in circulation,
      is a self-evident proposition. But how use-values which are incommensurable with regard to each other, are to be exchanged,
      en masse for the total sum of gold and silver in a country, is quite incomprehensible. If we start from the notion that all
      commodities together form one single commodity, of which each is but an aliquot part, we get the following beautiful result: The
      total commodity = x cwt. of gold; commodity A = an aliquot part of the total commodity = the same liquot part of x cwt. of
      gold. This is stated in all seriousness by Montesquieu: "Si l'on compare la masse de l'or et de l'argent qui est dans le monde
      avec la somme des merchandises qui y vent il est cenain que chaque denrée ou merchandise, en paniculier, pourra être
      comparée à une certaine portion de la masse entière. Supposons qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule denrée ou marchandise dans le
      monde, ou qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule qui s'achète, et qu'elle se divise comme l'argent: Cette panic de cette marchandise répondra
      à une partie de la masee de l'argent; la moitié du total de l'une a la moitié du total de l'autre, &c.... I'établissement du prix des
      choses dépend tonjours fondamentalement de la raison du total des choses au total des signes." (Montesquieu, l. c. t. III, pp.
      12, 13.) As to the further development of this theory by Ricardo and his disciples, James Mill, Lord Overstone, and others, see
      "Zur Kritik, &c.," pp. 140-146, and p. 150, sqq. John Stuart Mill, with his usual eclectic logic, understands how to hold at the
      same time the view of his father, James Mill, and the opposite view. On a comparison of the text of his compendium, "Principles
      of Poll Econ.," with his preface to the first edition, in which preface he announces himself as the Adam Smith of his day — we
      do not know whether to admire more the simplicity of the man, or that of the public, who took him, in good faith, for the Adam
      Smith he announced himself to be, although he bears about as much resemblance to Adam Smith as say General Williams, of
      Kars, to the Duke of Wellington. The original researches of Mr. J. S. Mill which are neither extensive nor profound, in the
      domain of Political Economy, will be found mustered in rank and file in his little work, "Some Unsettled Questions of Political
      Economy," which appeared in 1844. Locke asserts point blank the connexion between the absence of value in gold and silver,
      and the determination of their values by quantity alone. "Mankind having consented to put an imaginary value upon gold and
      silver ... the intrinsic value, regarded in these metals, is nothing but the quantity." ("Some Considerations," &c., 1691, Works
      Ed. 1777, Vol. II., p. 15.) 

      [34] It lies of course, entirely beyond my purpose to take into consideration such details as the seigniorage on minting. I will,
      however, cite for the benefit of the romantic sycophant, Adam Muller, who admires the "generous liberality" with which the
      English Government coins gratuitously, the following opinion of Sir Dudley North: "Silver and gold, like other commodities,
      have their ebbings and flowings. Upon the arrival of quantities from Spain ... it is carried into the Tower, and coined. Not long
      after there will come a demand for bullion to be exported again. If there is none, but all happens to be in coin, what then? Melt
      it down again; there's no loss in it, for the coining costs the owner nothing. Thus the nation has been abused, and made to pay
      for the twisting of straw for asses to eat. If the merchant were made to pay the price of the coinage, he would not have sent his
      silver to the Tower without consideration, and coined money would always keep a value above uncoined silver. " (North, l. c.,
      p. 18.) North was himself one of the foremost merchants in the reign of Charles II. 

      [35] "If silver never exceed what is wanted for the smaller payments it cannot be collected in sufficient quantities for the larger
      payments ... the use of gold in the main payments necessarily implies also Its use in the retail trade: those who have gold coin
      offering them for small purchases, and receiving with the commodity purchased a balance of silver in return; by which means the
      surplus of silver that would otherwise encumber the retail dealer, is drawn off and dispersed into general circulation. But if there
      is as much silver as will transact the small payments independent of gold, the retail trader must then receive silver for small
      purchases ; and it must of necessity accumulate in his hands." (David Buchanan; "Inquiry into the Taxation and Commercial
      Policy of Great Britain. " Edinburgh, 1844, pp. 248, 249.) 

      [36] The mandarin Wan-mao-in, the Chinese Chancellor of the Exchequer, took it into his head one day to lay before the Son
      of Heaven a proposal that secretly aimed at converting the assignats of the empire into convertible bank-notes. The assignats
      Committee, in its report of April, 1854, gives him a severe snubbing. Whether he also received the traditional drubbing with
      bamboos is not stated. The concluding part of the report is as follows: — "The Committee has carefully examined his proposal
      and finds that it is entirely in favour of the merchants, and that no advantage will result to the crown." ("Arbeiten der Kaiserlich
      Russischen Gesandtschaft zu Peking über China." Aus dem Russischen von Dr. K. Abel und F. A. Mecklenburg. Erster Band.
      Berlin, 1858, p. 47 sq.) In his evidence before the Committee of the House of Lords on the Bank Acts, a governor of the Bank
      of England says, with regard to the abrasion of gold coins during currency: "Every year a fresh class of sovereigns becomes too
      light. The class which one year passes with full weight, loses enough by wear and tear to draw the scales next year against it."
      (House of Lords' Committee, 1848, n. 429.) 

      [37] The following passage from Fullarton shows the want of clearness on the pan of even the best writers on money, in their
      comprehension of its various functions: "That, as far as concerns our domestic exchanges, all the monetary functions which are
      usually performed by gold and silver coins, may be performed as effectually by a circulation of inconvertible notes paying no
      value but that factitious and conventional value they derive from the law is a fact which admits, I conceive, of no denial. Value
      of this description may be made to answer all the purposes of intrinsic value, and supersede even the necessity for a standard,
      provided only the quantity of issues be kept under due limitation." (Fullerton: "Regulation of Currencies," London, 1845, p. 21.)
      Because the commodity that serves as money is capable of being replaced in circulation by mere symbols of value, therefore its
      functions as a measure of value and a standard of prices are declared to be superfluous! 

      [38] From the fact that gold and silver, so far as they are coins, or exclusively serve as the medium of circulation, become mere
      tokens of themselves, Nicholas Barbon deduces the right of Governments "to raise money," that is, to give to the weight of
      silver that is called a shilling the name of a greater weight, such as a crown; and so to pay creditors shillings, instead of crowns.
      "Money does wear and grow lighter by often telling over... It is the denomination and currency of the money that men regard in
      bargaining, and not the quantity of silver...'Tis the public authority upon the metal that makes it money." (N. Barbon, l. c., pp.
      29, 30, 25.) 

      [39] "Une richesse en argent n'est que ... richesse en productions, converties en argent." (Mercier de la Rivière, l. c.) "Une
      valeur en productions n'a fait que changer de forme." (Id., p. 486.) 

      [40] "'Tis by this practice' they keep all their goods and manufactures at such low rates." (Vanderlint, l. c., pp. 95, 96.) 

      [41] "Money ... is a pledge." (John Bellers: "Essays about the Poor, Manufactures, Trade, Plantations, and Immorality," Lond.,
      1699, p. 13.) 

      [42] A purchase. in a "categorical" sense, implies that gold and silver are already the converted form of commodities, or the
      product of a sale. 

      [43] Henry III., most Christian king of France, robbed cloisters of their relics, and turned them into money. It is well known
      what part the despoiling of the Delphic Temple, by the Phocians, played in the history of Greece. Temples with the ancients
      served as the dwellings of the gods of commodities. They were "sacred banks." With the Phoenicians, a trading people par
      excellence, money was the transmuted shape of everything. It was, therefore, quite in order that the virgins, who, at the feast of
      the Goddess of Love, gave themselves up to strangers, should offer to the goddess the piece of money they received.

     "Gold, yellow, glittering, precious gold! 
     Thus much of this, will make black white, foul, fair; 
     Wrong, right; base, noble; old, young; coward, valiant. 
     ... What this, you gods? Why, this 
     Will lug your priests and servants from your sides; 
     Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads; 
     This yellow slave 
     Will knit and break religions; bless the accurs'd; 
     Make the hoar leprosy ador'd; place thieves, 
     And give them title, knee and approbation; 
     With senators on the bench, this is it; 
     That makes the wappen'd widow wed again: 
     ... Come damned earth, 
     Though common whore of mankind."

      [45] "Accrescere quanto più si può il numero de'venditori d'ogni merce, diminuere quanto più si puo il numero dei compratori,
      quest) sono i cardini sui quali si raggirano tutte le operazioni di economia politica." (Verri, l. c., p. 52.) 

      [46] "There is required for carrying on the trade of the nation a determinate sum of specifick money which varies, and is
      sometimes more, sometimes less, as the circumstances we are in require.... This ebbing and flowing of money supplies and
      accommodates itself, without any aid of Politicians.... The buckets work alternately; when money is scarce, bullion is coined;
      when bullion is scarce, money is melted." (Sir D. North, l. c., Postscript, p. 3.) John Stuart Mill, who for a long time was an
      official of the East India Company, confirms the fact that in India silver ornaments still continue to perform directly the functions
      of a hoard. The silver ornaments are brought out and coined when there is a high rate of interest, and go back again when the
      rate of interest falls. (1. S. Mill's Evidence "Reports on Bank Acts," 1857, 2084.) According to a Parliamentary document of
      1864 on the gold and silver import and export of India, the import of gold and silver in 1863 exceeded the export by
      £19,367,764. During the 8 years immediately preceding 1864, the excess of imports over exports of the precious metals
      amounted to £109,652,917. During this century far more than £200,000,000 has been coined in India. 

      [47] The following shows the debtor and creditor relations existing between English traders at the beginning of the 18th century.
      "Such a spirit of crudity reigns here in England among the men of trade, that is not to be met with in any other society of men,
      nor in any other kingdom of the world." ("An Essay on Credit and the Bankrupt Act," Lond., 

      [48] It will be seen from the following quotation from my book which appeared in 1859, why I take no notice in the text of an
      opposite form: "Contrariwise, in the process in M—-C, the money can be alienated as a real means of purchase, and in that
      way, the price of the commodity can be realised before the use-value of the money is realised and the commodity actually
      delivered. This occurs constantly under the every-day form of prepayments. And it is under this form, that the English
      government purchases opium from the ryots of India.... In these cases, however, the money always acts as a means of
      purchase.... Of course capital also is advanced in the shape of money.... This point of view, however, does not fall within the
      horizon of simple circulation." ("Zur Kritik, &c.," pp. 119, 120.) 

      [49] The monetary crisis referred to in the text, being a phase of every crisis, must be clearly distinguished from that particular
      form of crisis, which also is called a monetary crisis, but which may be produced by itself as an independent phenomenon in
      such a way as to react only indirectly on industry and commerce. The pivot of these crises is to be found in moneyed capital,
      and their sphere of direct action is therefore the sphere of that capital, viz., banking, the stock exchange, and finance. 

      [50] "The sudden reversion from a system of credit to a system of hard cash heaps theoretical fright on top of the practical
      panic; and the dealers by whose agency circulation is affected, shudder before the impenetrable mystery in which their own
      economic relations are involved" (Karl Marx, l. c., p. 126.) "The poor stand still, because the rich have no money to employ
      them, though they have the same land and hands to provide victuals and clothes, as ever they had; ...which is the true riches of a
      nation, and not the money." John Bellers, Proposals for Raising a College of Industry, London, 1696, p3. 

      [51] The following shows how such times are exploited by the "amis du commerce." "On one occasion (1839) an old grasping
      banker (in the city) in his private room raised the lid of the desk he sat over, and displayed to a friend rolls of bank-notes,
      saying with intense glee there were £600,000 of them, they were held to make money tight, and would all be let out after three
      o'clock on the same day." ("The Theory of Exchanges. The Bank Charter Act of 1844." Lond. 1864, p. 81). The Observer, a
      semi-official government organ, contained the following paragraph on 24th April, 1864: "Some very curious rumours are
      current of the means which have been resorted to in order to create a scarcity of banknotes.... Questionable as it would seem,
      to suppose that any trick of the kind would be adopted, the report has been so universal that it really deserves mention." 

      [52] "The amount of purchases or contracts entered upon during the course of any given day, will not affect the quantity of
      money afloat on that particular day, but, in the vast majority of cases, will resolve themselves into multifarious drafts upon the
      quantity of money which may be afloat at subsequent dates more or less distant.... The bills granted or credits opened, to-day,
      need have no resemblance whatever, either in quantity, amount or duration, to those granted or entered upon to-morrow or
      next day, nay, many of today's bills, and credits, when due, fall in with a mass of liabilities whose origins traverse a range of
      antecedent dates altogether indefinite, bills at 12, 6, 3 months or 1 often aggregating together to swell the common liabilities of
      one particular day...." ("The Currency Theory Reviewed; in a Letter to the Scottish People." By a Banker in England.
      Edinburgh, 1845, pp. 29, 30 passim.)

      largest London houses of its yearly receipts and payments. Its transactions during the year 1856, extending to many millions of

      [56] "On Whitsuntide, 1824," says Mr. Craig before the Commons' Committee of 1826, "there was such an immense demand
      for notes upon the banks of Edinburgh, that by 11 o'clock they had not a note left in their custody. They sent round to all the
      different banks to borrow, but could not get them, and many of the transactions were adjusted by slips of paper only; yet by
      three o'clock the whole of the notes were returned into the banks from which they had issued! It was a mere transfer from hand
      to hand. "Although the average effective circulation of bank-notes in Scotland is less than three millions sterling, yet on certain
      pay days in the year, every single note in the possession of the bankers, amounting in the whole to about £7,000,000, is called
      into activity. On these occasions the notes have a single and specific function to perform, and so soon as they have performed
      it, they How back into the various banks from which they issued. (See John Fullarton, "Regulation of Currencies." Lond. 1845,
      p. 86, note.) In explanation it should be stated, that in Scotland, at the date of Fullarton's work, notes and not cheques were
      used to withdraw deposits.

      the author evidently meant direct. 

      [58] To the question, "If there were occasion to raise 40 millions p. a., whether the same 6 millions (gold) ... would suffice for
      such revolutions and circulations thereof, as trade requires," Petty replies in his usual masterly manner, "I answer yes: for the
      expense being 40 millions, if the revolutions were in such short circles, viz., weekly, as happens among poor artisans and
      labourers, who receive and pay every Saturday, then 40/52 parts of 1 million of money would answer these ends, but if the
      circles be quarterly, according to our custom of paying rent, and gathering taxes, then 10 millions were requisite. Wherefore,
      supposing payments in general to be of a mixed circle between one week and 13, then add 10 millions to 40/52, the half of
      which will be 5 1/2, so as if we have 5 1/2 millions we have enough." (William Petty: "Political Anatomy of Ireland." 1672,
      Edit.: Lond. 1691, pp. 13, 14.) 

      [59] Hence the absurdity of every law prescribing that the banks of a country shall form reserves of that precious metal alone
      which circulates at home. The "pleasant difficulties" thus self-created by the Bank of England, are well known. On the subject of
      the great epochs in the history of the changes in the relative value of gold and silver, see Karl Marx, l. c., p. 136 sq. Sir Robert
      Peel, by his Bank Act of 1844, sought to tide over the difficulty, by allowing the Bank of England to issue notes against silver
      bullion, on condition that the reserve of silver should never exceed more than one-fourth of the reserve of gold. The value of
      silver being for that purpose estimated at its price in the London market. 

      Added in the 4th German edition. — We find ourselves once more in a period of serious change in the relative values of gold
      and silver. About 25 years ago the ratio expressing the relative value of gold and silver was 15-1/2:1; now it is approximately
      22:1, and silver is still constantly falling as against gold. This is essentially the result of a revolution in the mode of production of
      both metals. Formerly gold was obtained almost exclusively by washing it out from gold-bearing allovial deposits, products of
      the weathering of auriferous rocks. Now this method has become inadequate and has been forced into the background by the
      processing of the quartz lodes themselves, a way of extraction which formerly was only of secondary importance, although well
      known to the ancients (Diodorus, 111, 12-14) (Diodor's v. Sicilien "Historische Bibliothek," book III, 12-14. Stuttgart 1828,
      pp. 258-261). Moreover, not only were new huge silver deposits discovered in North America, in the Western part of the
      Rocky Mountains, but these and the Mexican silver mines were really opened up by the laying of railways, which made
      possible the shipment of modern machinery and fuel and in consequence the mining of silver on a very large scale at a low cost.
      However there is a great difference in the way the two metals occur in the quartz lodes. The gold is mostly native, but
      disseminated throughout the quartz in minute quantities. The whole mass of the vein must therefore be crushed and the gold
      either washed out or extracted by means of mercury. Often 1,000,000 grammes of quartz barely yield 1-3 and very seldom
      30-60 grammes of gold. Silver is seldom found native, however it occurs in special quartz that is separated from the lode with
      comparative ease and contains mostly 40-90% silver; or it is contained, in smaller quantities, in copper, lead and other ores
      which in themselves are worthwhile working. From this alone it is apparent that the labour expended on the production of gold
      is rather in creasing while that expended on silver production has decidedly decreased, which quite naturally explains the drop
      in the value of the latter. This fall in value would express itself in a still greater fall in price if the price of silver were not pegged
      even to-day by artificial means. But America's rich silver deposits have so far barely been tapped, and thus the prospects are
      that the value of this metal will keep on dropping for rather a long time to come. A still greater contributing factor here is the
      relative decrease in the requirement of silver for articles of general use and for luxuries, that is its replacement by plated goods,
      aluminium, etc. One may thus gauge the utopianism of the bimetallist idea that compulsory international quotation will raise silver
      again to the old value ratio of 1:15-1/2. It is more likely that silver will forfeit its money function more and more in the markets
      of the world. — F E.] 

      [60] The opponents, themselves, of the mercantile system, a system which considered the settlement of surplus trade balances
      in gold and silver as the aim of international trade, entirely misconceived the functions of money of the world. I have shown by
      the example of Ricardo in what way their false conception of the laws that regulate the quantity of the circulating medium, is
      reflected in their equally false conception of the international movement of the precious metals (l. c., pp. 150 sq.). His erroneous
      dogma: "An unfavourable balance of trade never arises but from a redundant currency.... The exportation of the coin is caused
      by its cheapness, and is not the effect, but the cause of an unfavourable balance," already occurs in Barbon: "The Balance of
      Trade, if there be one, is not the cause of sending away the money out of a nation; but that proceeds from the difference of the
      value of bullion in every country." (N. Barbon; l. c., pp. 59, 60.) MacCulloch in "The Literature of Political Economy, a
      classified catalogue, Lond. 1845," praises Barbon for this anticipation, but prudently passes over the naive forms, in which
      Barbon clothes the absurd supposition on which the "currency principle" is based. The absence of real criticism and even of
      honesty, in that catalogue culminates in the sections devoted to the history of the theory of money; the reason is that
      MacCulloch in this part of the work is flattering Lord Overstone whom he calls "facile princeps argentanorum." 

      [61] For instance, in subsidies, money loans for carrying on wars or for enabling banks to resume cash payments, &c., it is the
      money-form, and no other, of value that may be wanted. 

      [62] "I would desire, indeed, no more convincing evidence of the competency of the machinery of the hoards in specie-paying
      countries to perform every necessary office of international adjustment, without any sensible aid from the general circulation,
      than the facility with which France, when but just recovering from the shock of a destructive foreign invasion, completed within
      the space of 27 months the payment of her forced contribution of nearly 20 millions to the allied powers, and a considerable
      proportion of the sum in specie, without any perceptible contraction or derangement of her domestic currency, or even any
      alarming fluctuation of her exchanges." (Fullerton, l. c., p. 141.) [Added in the 4th German edition. — We have a still more
      striking example in the facility with which the same France was able in 1871-73 to pay off within 30 months a forced
      contribution more than ten times as great, a considerable part of it likewise in specie. — F. E.] 

      [63] "L'argent se partage entre les nations relativement au besoin qu'elles en ont ... étant toujours attiré par les productions."
      (Le Trosne, l. c., p. 916.) "The mines which are continually giving gold and silver, do give sufficient to supply such a needful
      balance to every nation." (J. Vanderlint, l. c., p. 40.) 

      [64] "Exchanges rise and fall every week, and at some particular times in the year run high against a nation, and at other times
      run as high on the contrary." (N. Barbon, l. c., p. 39) 

      [65] These various functions are liable to come into dangerous conflict with one another whenever gold and silver have also to
      serve as a fund for the conversion of bank-notes. 

      [66] "What money is more than of absolute necessity for a Home Trade, is dead stock ... and brings no profit to that country
      it's kept in, but as it is transported in trade, as well as imported." (John Bellers, "Essays", p. 13.) "What if we have too much
      coin? We may melt down the heaviest and turn it into the splendour of plate, vessels or utensils of gold or silver, or send it out
      as a commodity, where the same is wanted or desired; or let it out at interest, where interest is high." (W. Petty:
      "Quantulumcunque," p. 39.) "Money is but the fat of the Body Politick, whereof too much cloth as often hinder its agility, as too
      little makes it sick ... as fat lubricates the motion of the muscles, feeds in want of victuals, fills up the uneven cavities, and
      beautifies the body; so cloth money in the state quicken its action, feeds from abroad in time of dearth at home, evens accounts
      ... and beautifies the whole; altho more especially the particular persons that have it in plenty." (W. Petty, "Political Anatomy of
      Ireland," p. 14.)
